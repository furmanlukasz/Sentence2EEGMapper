I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
If you don't mind perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
But you didn't even taste your cocoa.
Thanks Miz Wilkes but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going.
You got a point there...
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company you're not fit company for anyone else.
Must get lonely living out here all by yourself.
Sounds good.
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
Sure.
Well I just thought--oh look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
I'm not much of a critic.
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine and you could tell me what you think.
Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
It's right this way.
Sure.
God told me since I was his number- one fan that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?
Thank you.
I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
Excuse me that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see he's been missing for quite some time now and...
Anything you can tell me might help.
What do you want to know?
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
Guess you can tell from my reaction I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
Sorry didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
Oh my!
You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.
Did I do good?
Ahh!!!
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
Oh Paul this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh don't me. It's Windthorne right?
I'm almost done.
Yes Paul.
Dome Pear-igg-non it is.
I was fooling silly.  You need a cigarette because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book and you just have one and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
You don't know?
What things?
You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
Oh Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.
It will.
Paul this will be our legacy.
I'm glad you like it.
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry it's just that this is so wonderful.
Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne her first love right?
Maybe.
The stranger staying at the Inn is he someone from Misery's past?
Three more chapters to go.
Oh Paul. It's beautiful.
It's almost done. By dawn we'll be able to give Misery back to the world.
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
I know you do. I love you too Annie.  And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.
That's disgusting.
Be my guest.
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
Oh no reason you keep me prisoner you make me burn my book you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
Why are you so mean Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
Why what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
Don't talk to me like that.
I don't know it's weird but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
Paul don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
Why would I run away? I'm a writer Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best didn't you?
Now don't fuss Paul.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Paul my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
No I haven't.
You've been out of your room.
What?
Paul I know you've been out.
It is.
That's very kind of you but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
Why would you lose me?
When you first came here I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful brilliant famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
Annie what is it?
I think you're right.
Paul this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.
To Misery.
Oh God what have I done? I'm so sorry Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
It's perfect.
Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?
Absolutely. Listen if you can't find any it's okay. I just thought it might be nice.
You really think so?
Well it certainly says you.
Oh you. I just picked things up over the years.
Did you study decorating or do you just have a flair?
Oh I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
Wait let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
To Misery.
Yes to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine.
A toast?
Annie I think we should have a toast.
Oh.  You can't get this in a restaurant in New York.
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes never canned. And to give it that little extra zip I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
I've never had meatloaf this good what do you do to it?
Oh...
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
I hope you like it.
Oh Paul. It would be an honor.
To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
I'm going to play my records all day
Whenever he played Radio City who do you think was right there in the front row?
Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace don't you?
Not even a hint?
Have to wait.
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
...have to wait.
Yeah yeah...
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
You better. Oh Paul when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
Well is it fair? Should I keep going?
Nothing.
What?
What about a bee...?
I said that?
The what?
I'm telling you I can't.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
I can't write this anymore.
What's the matter Paul? You haven't written a word.
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
--cliff-hangers--
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
--not fair?
Paul what you've written just isn't fair.
I really value your criticism but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
Paul it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
I'm sorry Paul. This is all wrong you'll have to do it over again.
Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. Think of me as your inspiration.
Yeah well I wouldn't expect too much.
Here in case you think of any ideas.
I want my pain to go 'way Annie-- make it go 'way please Annie--  --please...
It'll only take a second.
I want my pills NOW!
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
Paul you're dripping with perspiration your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
Annie what's the matter?
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want I'll bring back the whole store for you.
No just the paper will be fine.
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything Annie. Not just the finished book but how it's written.
Well it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
C'mere I'll show you.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
You did great except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white long-grained mimeo.
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name Annie.
Great.
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.
You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
You just expect me to whip something off that it?
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh Paul you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her and now you'll make it right.
Misery's Return?
Oh but Paul!  I don't think I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all writers do need a place to work.
Set what up?
Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you Paul. Here. You just sit tight and I'll set everything up.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
See isn't this nice?
Great.
Yeah well it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
I don't know.
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
As long as it does exist your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match Paul.
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
Oh Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
You know Annie this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York there will be a big auction and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
I know this is the only copy Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
So you've indicated. Do it.
No big deal.
Then light the match Paul.
This isn't difficult my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it fine. You're not ridding the world of anything.
I know this may be difficult for you but it's for the best.
You want me to burn my book?
Yes.
You want me to burn my book?
Yes.
Show me the way?
I'll get you everything you want but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver.
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
Perfect.
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed this never would have happened. Here let me help you back in.  I know this hurts but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
She slipped away? She slipped away? She didn't just slip away. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You murdered my Misery.
No one--she just died--she slipped away that's all.
Then who did?
I DIDN'T...
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
Annie in 1871 women often died in childbirth but her spirit is the important thing and Misery's spirit is still alive--
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be a boy or a girl? Ooh don't tell me.
Well I hope you like it.
I'd love to stay here and chat but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real commitment.
Well it's not something you should enter into lightly.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.
No problem.
Yeah thanks.
Done?
I'm...
I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
I don't know about you but what I did to get through it was I dove into work--days nights--night shifts can be lonely at a hospital. I did a lot of reading. That was hen I first discovered Misery. She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems.  'Course I suppose you had a little something to do with that too.
I know how that can be.
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
Yeah that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world...
The Sistine Chapel?
I'm on page three-hundred now Paul and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
This farm was getting kind of dreary what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
I'm getting to believe you.
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
Misery?
I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul say hello to my favorite beast in all the world my sow Misery.
My pleasure.
Thank you so much.
You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
Well you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
I don't mean to pry but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
I guess that means it's okay.
I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.
Your agent said she would tell her you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
...it's like a visit from my oldest dearest friend.
My daughter must be going nuts.
Well mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh Paul I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
The phones are working?
The one to town is but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection you're not in any danger and as soon as the road to the hospital is open they'll send an ambulance for you.
Then the roads are open...
They had it at the store Paul there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
It's fine.
Oh I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
Well these are slum kids I was a slum kid everybody talks like that.
It has no nobility.
The profanity bothers you?
The swearing Paul.  There I said it.
Pretty rough so far.
Well it's brilliantly written but then everything you write is brilliant.
I can take it go ahead.
Oh it's ridiculous who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
No what is it?
Nothing.
But what?
Oh like I could do that?
What's it about?
I don't have a title yet.
What's your new book called?
You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor my agent and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
If you wouldn't mind.
You want to read it?
It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 
When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.
And you're very brilliant and you must be a good man or you could never have created such a wondrous loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done. 
You're very kind...
Lucky for you I did.  Lucky for me too. Because now you're alive and you can write more books. Oh Paul I've read everything of Yours but the Misery novels...
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well the other afternoon I was on my way home and there you were leaving the Lodge and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
Say that last part again I didn't quite hear--
Well it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
Following me?
No it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way I was following you.
Of course you will. And your arm will be fine too. Your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly but I finally popped it back in there.  But what I'm most proud of is the work I did on those legs. Considering what I had around the house I don't think there's a doctor who could have done any better.
Will I be able to walk?
Your legs just sing grand opera when you move don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever Paul I promise you.
The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling but the phone lines are down.
Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
They're called Novril--they're for your pain. 
What are they...?
Here.
--my number one fan.
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
How long...?
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
There's that spice again.
It's good you found it.
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
What is it?
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
What thing?
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
Oh I like that tone.
Just leave it all right?
That's nice.
They're hauling Misery into court.
What?
Now you see it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice.
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
Virginia I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon at least I can find out what he wrote about.
Well whoever she is she sure likes to read a lot.
Hey Jim what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye.
There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
You don't think he's dead do you?
Just from his agent.
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?
Hope not--if he is he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
You really think Sheldon's out there?
Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
Could be the weight of the snow.
What? What is it?
Stop--stop right here.
Well this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
Virginia when you're in this car you're not my wife you're my deputy.
Four or five days ago. Why?
Work work work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
G'bye Ms. Sindell.
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
I hate that I made this call--tell me I'm being silly.
You think he might be missing?
No no of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him and when he's got a book coming out he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
I don't know. Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels?
Not quite. I just called and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
Yeah I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
People sure like those Misery books.
Yes he is.
He's your client huh?
Yes.
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
I'm a literary agent and I feel like a fool calling you but I think one of my clients Paul Sheldon might be in some kind of trouble.
I'm sure you're right.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
So do I...
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all famous and all he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest never made a noise never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
No long-distance phone calls Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
No see he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
Maybe you can Libby.
Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving Buster--you can tell by the champagne.
Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that.
No the typing kind.
Newspapers?
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
Has she been buying any odd things lately?
Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book she makes me set aside the first copy.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one would you?
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
If I can.
Answer me a couple things?
Buster.
Hey Pete.
I am. Well maybe not completely--
I thought you were over it.
Now you've hurt me Paul.
Gee Marcia if I didn't know you better I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
Paul since you brought her up I have to ask you this or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts but in some way Annie Wilkes that whole experience helped me.
I'm delighted the critics are liking it and I hope the people like it too. But it's not why I wrote the book.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
Great.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
That'd be a first.
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
Here it is.  Very first copy.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
Did they win?
Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball game went into overtime. If anybody ever told me I'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double I'd...
Marcia why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness?  I'm doing this because I have to.  Now I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts--because if I can make it work ...  I might just have something that I want on my tombstone.
No no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
Marcia please.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
You're still a writer.
When I wrote my first book I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book Marcia. I was a writer then.
It's... it's nice Paul. It's got... character.
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
