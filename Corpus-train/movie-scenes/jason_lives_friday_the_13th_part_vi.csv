No way...  ...I wanna rock!
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
Alright alright.
Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
What?  Who pulled it out?!
Go out and plug the cord back in.
What?
My friggin' stepfather and asshole- in-residence.
Who's Horace?
If this thing is burned out friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
Great.  Just great.
I thought that was the end of the song.
Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
Oh jeez.
Just drive.  He'll get out of our way.
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
We're gonna scare him?!
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
Why?  Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.
Why?
Darren we better turn around.
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
He didn't say anything?
I don't know.  He called somebody then took off.
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
Yeah we're here.
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
Of course not.  She probably took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it.  I still don't get it.  Why him?  I mean he's cute alright but...
No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
Huh?  Oh come on Sis.  I'm tellin' ya we can't play Clue with just two people.
Okay okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom by Colonel Mustard with the knife.
You gotta be kidding!
Boy scouting.
Which is?
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
So where's Cort gone off to?
All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
Doesn't that tell you something?!
If I had you where I really wanted you they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
Please don't do anything crazy.
With extreme car for God's sake. If that kid is with her there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
Don't concern yourself Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
Please Sheriff.  You'll see we dug it up.
I've seen it.
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
But they have to be warned Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter or anyone else with your warped mind.
No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
Yes!
I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
If you'd just go to the cemetery you'll see I'm not lying.
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
Why didn't you cremate him?!
There's no time for this bullshit...
No problem Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
Yes but they released me because...
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since haven't you?
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
Tommy Jarvis.  We gotta do something.  He's even more powerful now that...
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name son?
Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...
Don't piss me off junior.  Or I will repaint this office with your brains.
Will you listen dammit!
Now you better cool out a minute boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
