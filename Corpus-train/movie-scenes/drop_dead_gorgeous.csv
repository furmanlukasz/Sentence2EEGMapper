I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln Alabama -- look out!
I just I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
Okay sweetie that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
I gotta work with these women.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
Loretta don't do that.
I got it! Yeah why don't ya take a...
Airport Ho-Jo!
There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
Right by the airport -- Oh Amber...
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
What? For chrissakes spit it out.
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
This came for you sweetie.
I never liked her but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
Okay.
No. It's pure bullshit sweetie. You're lucky as hell so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
Really?
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
What is wrong with you?
...Yah -- well at least y'know I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...
Thank God for bunge cords.
Oh Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
Loretta never have kids.
Oh shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
My mom wanted me to have this?
You-betcha.
Really Loretta?
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
Oh-yah.
No. Mom said if I did she'd look up my dad and marry him.
Hell-no she ain't quittin'.
Yeah you betcha...
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
So what do I say?
Oh God I'm dead...
I heard you I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes Amber the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
You're what?!
Don't let that worry you Annette!
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
She's right over there.
Where is she?!
She's alive sweetie.
Is Mom okay?
Oh-you-beccha.
Yah?
Lis I want to I really do but... Oh I can't.
Oh c'mon I love 'em but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Your parents'd kill you.
My jacket. Take it 'cause y'know I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
I'm gonna need more caps.
No don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
Amber...
-- red nose and ears. I know I know.
Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
It's okay.
We was robbed.
Bye mom.
I love you much.
C'mere. I love you so much.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win Amber.
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
Honest to God if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
That's it I'm goin'...
Oh c'mon... First the picture of Tammy then Brett Clemens now this? It's scary.
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
Nice mouth you got there Mom but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.
Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta you too.
Ow!
What?!
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda y'know I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
Mom!
Mom look don't say anything. First of all I'm not pregnant.
Go on! Get out!
Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
Oh Mom it's so ugly.
Oh... How quickly they grow up.  Hey if they ask you to take off your shirt get the money first.
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
Oh shit!
That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.
Hey Amber y'get my smokes?
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville her hometown. Those were different times.
Good 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's it's Nazi Germany!
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
This this... This is bullshit!
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
But doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete overrule that rule?
Amber I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
Mrs. Clark why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
We all do. Now let's go.
I hate her!
No wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you Becky. Where is it?
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
Bitch!
If you want seconds then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
She's the prettiest y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass Loretta.
Let's just say who should win who deserves to win is Amber.
Oh Christ it's true.
Shut it up Loretta.
Y'know if you have you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Loretta shut it.
Say yous boys been to the Leeman's?
This here's Loretta.
Oh naw. Hi.
It's just the guys that are... you know makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
Hi.
Hi.
You could be quiet.
Oh Jesus H. Christ!
What do you mean they take out her butt?
Listen little missy this cost your dad a pretty penny. Now get your ass up there and show me some teeth.
My dress'll reek.
Oh for chrissakes everything smells like that in Mexico.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
C'mon Rebecca you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon now.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
Well it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious it hardly seems real y'know? I mean I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
The important thing is that we have a winner...
The bitch.
All right then.
Wisconsin.
What?
That bitch from...
Ohio...
Dakota.
Yeah.
People people -- wait wait a minute here. Uh while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa Wisconsin North Dakota...
Mm-hm.
Okay?
That's right.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
I'm a mirror.
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
And the year before that?
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals too.
Yeah.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
Girls check in but they don't check out.
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Tammy Curry?
...Oh yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God it's COPS!
That's enough!
Becky was my only shot at state!
So help me Gladys.
Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. Ah- hahahahahahahaha!
Gladys! Stop it!
Hey Ted sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo they love that.
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
Yeah yeah the Jew.
Sammy Davis Jr. honey.
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
Oh all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.
Lester?
We're not in the showroom Dear.
Hey ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Oh Lester. He loves his weather y'know.
...You betcha. S'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...
I swear to God she can't do anything by herself.
Enid ate a whole pan!
This is -- what?
We need more bars!
What!
Uh Gladys?
Okay I designed the float you know. And what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
Number one American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.
Okay everybody listen up!
So remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
Yeah.
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
Well you know I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
Oh! What is it?
All right let's go.
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
Oh there's a parking space over there. Oh no that's just a compact. Sorry.
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
Iris stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
Oh my!  Hello Father Donigan! Sidewalks sidewalks?
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
Y'betcha Iris. We still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.
Nothin' too showy!
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner I'm just gonna leave it in ya.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
You get nothing Hank okay?
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
Close up shop!
Harold!
Close up shop. Close up shop Hank.
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
I will if you shut your piehole.
Well Mom's dead so shut your fly trap.
Ow Harold -- Mom said not the head.
Shut up Hank. This here's business.
What you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
Oh I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
Mom I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put like this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
