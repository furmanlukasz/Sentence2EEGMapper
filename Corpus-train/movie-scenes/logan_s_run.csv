Well why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
Dunno... flameout maybe. Whatever happens you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out?
Just wondered... what happens?
Why?
Not in my time...
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
Had enough?
Maybe maybe not. What's the difference? Come on Logan let's get out of here before everybody finds out.
Open your eyes once idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you Francis -- that's him!
You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
Turn this way.  No no... not you... YOU!
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
Yes. Oh yes.  He was after you. I remember. You're running!
...and he was hunting the first one this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running the other one was hunting him...
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing killing burning!
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
No Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
When do you go up?
I'm very smart.
Why aren't you in Nursery?
Here.
Where do you live Mary?
I'm Mary 2.
What's your name?
Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
Is it inside the city?
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
What does that water do?
Beloved wife...
Beloved husband...
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less either...
And Sanctuary?
Yes. You and I Jessica. 
I want to be alive and with you that's all I want.
Jessica... listen to me... listen to me...  The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand?
You want to go back to kill is that it?! Now you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!
Things change!
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
To what?
We can't. We're going back.
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!!
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
There's a Sanctuary... there is!
One in a million I suppose
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
It could be...
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
Yes do you think that's why he looks so sad?
I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
Then the answer's yes...
Of course.
...But I still have the choice...?
You know Jessica.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
What does it mean?
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long did they?
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
I won't.
Don't ever let go.
I doubt it.
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
Sooner or later we'll have to try something.
Don't!
We'll be all right...  We will...
I hate outside! I hate it!
And yours.
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
What's that?
For us.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
Because you felt like a Runner didn't you.
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
You knew that I wasn't before didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
You're really one of us now aren't you?
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
It's brighter there... besides we can't go back.
I'm afraid.
Ycch.  To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world.
Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals fish anything...  ...to eat of course.
What do you suppose this was...?
It's the only way.
How do we know this is the right way?
Why Jessica? You're still a green.
Will you take me with you?
They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.
How will they know we're coming?
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here you'll have to get behind me.
We'll convince them.
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me
They won't listen.
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
They won't believe us.
Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...
He's good isn't he?
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
Are you taking me to them?
No. Not that either.
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
I -- I can't.
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
Yes but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you Logan. Maybe me too now...
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
Logan I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them they'll kill you.
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
Muscle? I don't know that one.
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
But what is this -- why?
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
Let's see -- how long has it been?
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive Logan?
When did you begin to question Lastday?
I have.
Uh-uh.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
Some people say children need human mothering.
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
They're like beasts. Wild.
That's nice.
I'd rather be with you.
Why not? Maybe she'll help me. You won't. You'd better stay here.
You're not going are you?
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
If you trusted me you'd know.
Of course --
If you did know you'd tell me.
I wish I knew what you think I know.
Maybe you'll think of something...
I wish I could help you.
That's tomorrow.
What're you going to do?
What do you need?
Are you here to help me?
And I never heard of Sanctuary.
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
I don't have much time.
Please? What friends?
Speak to your friends for me Jessica... please...
I don't..
I let him go... believe me.
And then you killed him right?
A Runner gave it to me.
Where did you get that?
How can I?
It's different now. Help me.
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
About running dying what?
You know something.
Why tell me?
I'm going to run.
Why show me?
All right.
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
You know.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
Then it's still no.
Of course.
Thanks... but I have the choice.
Maybe... sure...
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen I suppose?
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
Here I am.  Shall I come in?
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
You could have called me yourself.
You're sure you don't want to try?
K.
What Quad do you live in?
You're years away... I don't know why you're thinking of these things much less talking about them.  Want to try?
Six. I go red next year.
Are you a 5 or a 6? 
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
Why is it wrong to run?
I'm not armed.  Well?
I'm afraid to tell you.
I'm listening.
Not about that.
Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.
How a Sandman lives.
About what?
Curious.
And now?
I changed my mind.
And?
I thought I had to do something.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
No.
Later.
No.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
Jessica.
You felt sad. What's your name?
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
Killed? Why do you use that word?
He was killed.
Yes... probably he was renewed?
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
Sad? What made you sad?
Nothing. I felt sad I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
Well then...?
No.
You prefer women?
No.  Just no.
Please... No.
What's wrong Available?
Oh my...
Goodbye.
Where are you going?
Come with us.
We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
At least it's over...
I'll make the arrangements.
They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...
What's that?
We'll have to bury him.
I don't know... but it does.
What people?
All this. All of it.
What belongs to the people?
No.
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
I don't know.
What kind of jewel is this?
Mother and Father said so... you know?
Are you sure?
Yes...
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
Yes cats of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
No -- Look I'm in a hurry.
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
It's all right with me. Is he here?
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
Do you want to see Doc?
Hello.
Hello Sandman.
Oh my... I'll try.
Can you make it back?
Yes...
I'm sorry.
Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
Oh yes... I think...
Stay? They lived together all their years?
That's better than gold when it's cold.
I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
And all alive you say?
More... many more.
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
Alive?
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
We're leaving.
All right.
Not yet.
Are you ready to put him in?
Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
Never never ever. Nothing.
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
No no no
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
Where are they?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
What makes you think so?
But there may be a few around somewhere.
Have any other people ever passed through?
Gracious... no.
Are there any other humans?
I have always been here...
How did you get here?
Just a place I suppose... who knows?
What kind of place is this?
For as long as I can remember.
How long have you been living here?
No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside Jessica.
Someone will follow. When you come to the lock he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.
Logan-5... Francis-7 authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
Break-in scanners report intrusion identify.
You don't seem quite sure Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
Too little?  Too little. Okay wait for me.
Too little.
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much you think?
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Well? How do you like it?
