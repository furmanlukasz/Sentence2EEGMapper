Agent Mapp! Thank you!
Agent Starling! Telephone!
He knew her...!
Hot damn Clarice.
But why? He didn't weight the others.
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
Fredrica Bimmel from Belvedere Ohio. The first girl taken but the third body found... Why?
The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
What girl?
Well except for the one girl.
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
Not random at all maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
He's here Ardelia.
Lecter said a lot of things.
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said everything I need to catch him is right here in these pages...
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
Why not?
No. He won't come after me.
Somebody's coaching her... They're trying to make him see Catherine as a person - not just an object.
Why does she keep repeating the name?
Boy is that smart...
Pleading with a crazy man with come all over my face.
You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
Thanks Ardelia.
Phone call Clarice. It's God.
What'd I do?
I love it when you talk dirty.
Never cock. Just squeeze.
Damn Clarice how'd you make me?
Listen I hope you never need a thing I've taught you. But you've got something... Jack sees it I do too. If you ever need to you can shoot.
I will... I promise.
Wear it don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife Bella is real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' you about it now 'cause he may never.
Sometimes.
Jack's pretty tough on you isn't he? Impatient...
I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid the CU- 5 with film packs and batteries.
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
Where?
Get your field gear take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.
Shut UP!  The other officers will be here any minute! you're perfectly safe now!
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here DON'T YOU - YOU
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room just for a minute but -
I don't know! Get me out!!
I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up.  Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
Get me out!
You're all right! Where is he?
Safe SHIT he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
FBI Catherine you're safe.
He's my patient! I have rights!  I'm not just some turnkey Miss Starling. I shouldn't even be here this afternoon. I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice.
Dr. Chilton I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
What you're doing Miss Starling is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company.
You might have suggested that in my office and saved me the time.
Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions... On the afternoon of July 8 1981 he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary. His mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an EKG. When the nurse bent over him he did this to her...
I understand.
Do not reach through the bars do not touch the bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils. No staples or paperclips in his paper. Use the sliding food carrier no exceptions. Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you. Do you understand me?
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
I graduated magna from UVA Doctor. It's not a charm school.
How do you mean Dr. Chilton?
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever isn't he? Using you.
I see.  Let's make this quick then. I'm busy.
I'm sure it's a great town Dr. Chilton but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
The market in Lecter hints is way down today okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis and three civilians. I've got -
But then he had to cover up make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
Starling -
Maybe he lives in this this Belvedere Ohio too! Maybe he saw her every day and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
Do you need a police escort Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?
He gave us a perfectly good description and we're on it now so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his either. He's under close guard at the courthouse pending a prison transfer. The next plane Officer.
Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least he used to. If I could just -
Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun too. Be on the next plane Starling there's one in 90 minutes.
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director and the Director answers to me. My God Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.
Sir Mr. Crawford instructed me -
You're out of line Starling and you're off this case. Back to Quantico.
Not yet! - just wait for me.  Maybe in about two seconds.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now Miss Starling.
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
Oh.
That wasn't me.
You're playing a piano Miss Starling?
Okay Mr. Yow...
Okay Miss Starling?
Good idea.
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Mr. Yow if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
I won't disturb anything Mr. Yow I promise. Be gone before you know it.
Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But if you say this is an FBI matter...
Did she leave any records here? Tax or business records? Maybe a list of employees?
Yes. I bought the house from her two years ago.
Mr. Gordon did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
I think we may be yes.
Are they close to catching somebody do you think?
Thanks.
Mrs. Lippman had a son maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside while I looks for it?
No. Wait... Was she a great fat person? I may have seen her I'm not sure...
Mr. Gordon did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
Jack Gordon.
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you please?
Just briefly. What's the problem Officer?
Excuse me but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
Yes sir. Thank you sir...
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
Yes sir... I'll do my best.
No Starling there isn't time. And you've still got crucial work to do in Ohio. We want him for murder not kidnapping. I'm counting on you to link him to the Bimmel girl before he's indicted.
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
Sewing...
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where Starling he took vocational rehab and learned a useful trade...
Sir that's great news. But how -
Where?
Starling we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin so that -
Starling -
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
Why not?
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious precise never impulsive... This won't end in suicide like they often do.
Why?
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house somewhere. Not an apartment.
Talk about him Starling. Tell me what you see.
Good idea but he thought of it too. We've run simulations using different vectors and the best dates we can assign. You put it all in the computer and smoke comes out. No this one is different. This one has seen us coming...
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
Blue square for Belvedere Ohio where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls in different colors. This new one today... washed up here.  Elk River in West Virginia about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.
You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not what can they do? Take away his books for awhile and no jello...  I know it got ugly today. But this is your report Starling - take it as far as you can. On your own time outside of class. Now carry on.
I'm here sir I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him all afternoon and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
Murdered...? How?
Miggs has been murdered.
Sir what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
Then do that Starling. Do just exactly that.
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Do you recall my instructions to you Starling? What were they?
Sir that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
Well? Why aren't you there right now?
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir why? Is something wrong?
Every word Starling? Every gesture?
It's all there sir practically verbatim.
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
And what is that sir?
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them for any reason. You tell him nothing personal Starling. Believe me you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job but never forget what he is.
Yes sir.
Now. I want your full attention Starling. Are you listening to me?
You're qualified and available. And frankly I can't spare a real agent right now.
Yes well... Okay right. I'm glad for the chance sir but - why me?
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
Who's the subject?
You see the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today in the asylum.
Not yet.
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast these people... Do you spook easily Starling?
A job's come up and I thought about you. Not really a job more of - an interesting errand. Walk me to my car Starling.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
Good morning Mr. Crawford.
Starling Clarice M. good morning.
Dr. Lecter...
They live in Malaysia. In this country they'd have to be specially raised from imported eggs.
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
Not lately. But maybe someday.
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
I try to be a student Dr. Pilcher.
What do you do when you're not detecting Officer Starling?
Freddie was so happy for me when I got this job. This - toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow on the speakers all day - she thought this was really hot shit. What did she know big dummy...
Sometimes you do.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean better places then this?
I think so.
Is that a pretty good job FBI agent?
She died. She went to Florida to retire like two years ago? She dies own there.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
Oh sure me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like totally old it was more'n she could handle.
Did you ever work with her?
No way. She had a guy I'da known believe me. Sewing was her life she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
Stacy did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
They said she was just rags like somebody -
Goodbye Clarice...  You looked - so very lovely today in your blue suit.
You know I can't make that promise.
I have no plans to call on you Clarice the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
Dr. Lecter -
Your lambs are still for now Clarice but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you and the plight will never end.
Well Clarice have the lambs stopped screaming...?
Starling.
Promise...?  Then why not take your case file? I won't be needing it anymore.
Yes. I'll tell you.
Brave Clarice. Will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming?
Dr. Chilton... I believe you know each other?
Tell me his name Dr. Lecter.
Thank you Clarice.
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Do you think if you saved Catherine you could make them stop...? Do you think if Catherine lives you won't wake up in the dark ever again to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?
Yes...
You still wake up sometimes don't you? Wake up in the dark with the lambs screaming?
But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...
Where were you going?
I took one lamb. And I ran away as fast as I could...
But you could. You did.
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there confused. They wouldn't run...
So you ran away...
Yes...! They were screaming.
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
What did you do?
What was it?
I heard a strange sound...
Then something woke you. What? Did you dream...? What was it?
Early. Still dark.
Nobody sent me. I came on my own.
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
Yes Doctor. Please.
That's enough I think. Happy hunting. Oh and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?
How would he test?
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach Wechsler House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
On what basis would they reject him?
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins the University of Minnesota and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them and been rejected.
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
Billy's not a real transsexual but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things I expect.
No...! Quid pro quo Doctor.
Did he try to?
No.
Why Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
I - ran away...
Why so briefly?
Two months.
How long did you live there?
Horses - and sheep...
A cattle ranch?
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
After your father's death you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes Clarice.
No. Tell me why.
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
Dr. Lecter there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change too Clarice. But there's the problem of his size you see. Even if he were a woman he'd have to be a big one...
Quid pro quo Doctor.
You're very frank Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
No. He was strong he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me I had nobody. I was ten years old.
Killed outright?
He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.
Tell me. Don't lie or I'll know.
The death of my father.
What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
Go Doctor.
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
I'm waiting for your offer Clarice. Enchant me.
A moth... How did you predict that?
Was it a butterfly?
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
Mmm. And what else...?
They all were.
Big through the hips. Roomy.
Yes.
Life's too slippery for books Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
By the book he's a sadist.
I was your choice Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him all those years ago...? That's impossible.
Oh a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
Who killed your patient?
I've been in this room for eight years Clarice. I know they will never ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree or even water. I want to be in a federal institution away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me but he won't. You persuade him.
Who killed Raspail Doctor...? You know don't you?
Punishment you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? There's something Crawford can give me and I want to trade for it. I even wrote to him offering my help. But he hates me so he won't deal directly.
I don't know. Is it?
Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you and imagine how good you would taste...?
That doesn't interest me Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
Your first lie to me Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you sexually? True he's much older but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios exchanges...? Fucking you?
I never thought about it.
Jack Crawford is helping your career isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him too.
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
Do you have something you use when you need to get up your courage? Memories tableaux... scenes from your early life?
Because you weren't wasting my time.
Ahhh... Why?
Scared at first. Then - exhilarated.
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
Who can say...? Best thing for him really. His therapy was going nowhere.
If you didn't kill him then who did?
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
Why? Do you know something about him?
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Your bleeding has stopped.
Advancement of course.  Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T... Now go. Go.  I don't think Miggs could manage again so soon even if he is crazy - do you?
What's that Dr. Lecter?
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most Clarice Starling.
Then please - do this test for me.
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school little Starling.
And the questionnaire...?
And you'd hate to think you were common. My wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.
Reasonably so. Yes.
You're a tough one aren't you?
You see a lot Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth.  Or maybe you're afraid to.
No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
Oh Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
No. You ate yours.
I didn't.
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
Partially yes. But Doctor that's an active case I'm not involved. If -
All flayed...?
Five... so far.
How many women has he used our Bill?
No I came because we need -
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
I'm only asking you to look at this Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
No no no. You were doing fine you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.
Dr. Lecter if you'd please consider -
Memory Officer Starling is what I have instead of view.
All that detail just from memory...?
Yes. That's the Duomo seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
Did you do those drawings Doctor?
I have no doubt of it.
Maybe they'll catch up.
It's much better than your shoes.
Yes.
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps but not today. You brought your best bag though didn't you?
Doctor we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
Would you Doctor? That would be so kind.
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
Oh that's clever Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me just as fast as you can then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order We'll ask twice a day just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson over at Johns Hopkins and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats when the next one floats and the next one - why we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building and a funny nose?
Look... search your own records if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.
That's a childish bullying stunt Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon so you can put away your picture.
Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow or tomorrow night he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.
You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust and we never will.
Dr. Danielson the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away.
I'm not having a witch hunt here Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent non-violent people with a real problem.
Oh and Senator...? Love you suit.
Thank you Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
