Yes Miss Betsy.  I mean that.  The Houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to Shango and Damballa.
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
They even cure nonsense Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
That's nonsense Alma.
At the Houmfort.
Where?
There are other doctors...Yes other doctors...Better doctors...
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
Doctors and nurses can only do so much Alma.  They can't cure everything.
Things so bad nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell.
Looks like an awful lot of breakfast -- I don't know whether I'll be able to get away with it.
What's this?
I do my best.  Every day I dress her just as beautifully as if she was well.  It's just like dressing a great big doll.
We'll see if we can't make her well Alma you and I.
She was very sick and then she went mindless Miss.
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her Alma?
Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.
Thank you Alma.
I know miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back now and I'll mix you your coffee.
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse Alma. You don't have to do that for me.
I didn't want to frighten you out of your sleep Miss.  That's why I touched you farthest from your heart.
Thank you for waking me.
Good morning miss.
If you say miss.  If you say.
But they came to a beautiful place didn't they?
If you say miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
You mean a figurehead.
No miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
Alive?
A man miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful weeping look on his black face.
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
Times gone Fort Holland was a fort...now no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
Mrs. Rand was at the Houmfort that night.  But there's nothing wrong with that.  She's gone there for years -- trying to take care of those people  to help them.
You must Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
Mrs. Rand...
That's sweet of you Mrs. Rand.
Why Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
Perhaps not.  But I did come here and I found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me. Once started it seemed such an easy way to do good.  I should have known there was no easy way to do good Betsy.
But you didn't have to come up here.
-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health good sanitation good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then almost accidentally I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god Shango would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.
I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
But Mrs. Rand --
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
Mrs. Rand.
Her son drowned.  She brooded until her mind was affected. All the Houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology.
Frankly my dear I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
I don't mean believe like believing in a religion.  I mean do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely is it?
You don't believe in it?
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
You've never said anything about voodoo before Mrs. Rand.
Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
I'd love to.
So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy too Miss Connell a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
Thank you Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
Nonsense child!  I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately.  I know a great deal more about what goes on at Fort Holland than you'd think.  I know all about you -- that you're a nice girl competent and kind to Jessica.  The Fort needs a girl like you.  But now we've got to get you back there.  I'll walk you back and stay over night.  It'll be a nice change for me.
Believe me Mrs. Rand he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him --
Come come don't tell me how sorry you are that I should meet you this way.  I'm even a little glad that Wesley's difficulty brought us together.
Oh Mrs. Rand --
I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.
Ti-Joseph?
I'm afraid so.
I think you need some help.
I would have stayed anyway Dr. Maxwell.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
Thank you.
I prepared these for you last night Miss Connell.
Fortunately not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
I've never heard of a cure.
She can never be cured?
I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing knowing nothing.
Does she suffer?
That's rather nice isn't it?
But it's so far away...
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad you know.
The West Indies?
No this is quite final.  You see Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
That will mean another interview won't it?
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions though about the Directress of Training.
At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
Where were you trained?
Yes.
You're single?
Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape never able to forget.  Please Betsy -- it's only merciful.
No Wes.
Please Wes do as I ask.  You must rest you must sleep.
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind no senses -- no love no hate no feeling -- nothing!
But she's not dead Wes.
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life an hour at a time...
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?
Of course Wes.
Betsy can I talk to you a minute?
I'd like to go now Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you isn't he? That won't last long.
That doesn't sound like him.
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
I wish I hadn't heard --
Did you hear what he sang?
Don't let it bother you so Wes.
Wait. I want to listen.
Listen did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --
I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks six ounces.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
Bring me another Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
By a curious coincidence it's my day off too.
But don't you have to work?
Well -- and things -- might be a better description of what you'll find.  I'd better come along and show you the town.
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops restaurants and things?
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
It's my day off.
Where do you think you're going?
It'll wait.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
Ah yes our Paul strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
Yes the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation and I as you must have noticed have all the charm.
Mr. Holland?
Don't worry.  I wasn't missed.  The only important man here is the owner.
Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
As a matter of fact it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me.
We're half-brothers.  Paul is mother's first child.  When his father died she married my father. Dr. Rand the missionary.  And you know what they say about missionaries' children.
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
-- But you're an American?
My brother's wife.
Thank you.  But who sits there? 
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
I like her already.
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman mother.  You'll like her.
Is she a doctor?
And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise in fact to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.
Yes -- on the boat.
It seems we are having dinner by ourselves Miss Connell.  But I may as well introduce everyone to you anyway.  There -- in the master's chair sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland.  But you've already met him.
I guess I'll wait until I'm home Mrs. Rand.
Considering that the paper is three months old and this isn't Sunday -- no thank you.
Yes.
You want that?
I want you to be safe Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her to madden her.
Don't Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me to help me -- I turned you away.
You wanted to warn me...
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel Paul.
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
I hated her.
She was beautiful.
You think I love Jessica and want her back. It is like you to think that -- clean decent thinking.
What I saw the other night I didn't dare believe Betsy --
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
I told you.
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
Help me? How?
I wanted to help you.
Instead -- you come with sympathy Betsy and a generous heart. Don't forget that.  Don't call it nothing.
And instead  I came -- bringing you nothing.
I imagined this so differently...
Don't take it to heart Betsy.
She is alive Mr. Holland -- that's all.
Well?
Didn't I?  I don't know.  That's the simple truth of it.  I don't know.
You didn't drive her mad.
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
I love Fort Holland.
You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
I don't know.  I wanted to help you. And now that I'm here I don't know how.
Why did you come in here?
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here violently.
I often do.
I heard you playing.
I'm afraid it's not very frightening.  They have their songs and dances and carry on and finally as I understand it one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people.
You don't seem very disturbed by it.  I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened.
I'm afraid the decanter will have to stay where it is.  I engaged you Miss Connell to take care of my wife not my brother.
Still I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
It's always stood there Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
Yes he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
Wesley can be very entertaining.
Well I had a good time up to a point.
