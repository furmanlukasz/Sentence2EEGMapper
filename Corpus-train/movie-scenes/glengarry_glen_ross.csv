You need money?  Is that the...
Is that what I just said?
Do you need five grand?
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
Why?
So I'm making it concrete.
In the abstract...
You went for it.
Well well well talk to me we sat down to eat dinner and here I'm a criminal...
That's none of your fucking business...
Why are you doing this to me Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
That's right.
Why?  Why because you only told me about it?
Then tough luck George because you are.
I didn't ask to be.
Well to the law you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
That's ridiculous.
Absolutely.
Me?
...they take me then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
...I thought that we were only talking...
...and rob the place...
...you don't have to come in...
Then listen to this: I have to get those leads tonight.  That's something I have to do.  If I'm not at the movies...if I'm not eating over at the inn...If you don't do this then I have to come in here...
Yes.  I'm sure.
Are you sure?
No.
You wouldn't George that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
Why would I do it?
They're going to come to everyone.
Why would they come to me?
They come to you you going to turn me in?
What if you don't get caught?
Listen to this.  I have an alibi I'm going to the Como Inn why? Why?  The place gets robbed they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?
What does that mean?
Oh yes George.
Yes.
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
Yes.
Dave.
What will they know?  That I stole the leads?  I didn't steal the leads I'm going to the movies tonight with a friend and then I'm going to the Como Inn.  Why did I go to Graff?  I got a better deal. Period.  Let 'em prove something. They can't prove anything that's not the case.
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
I...
Yes.
You have to go in.  You have to get the leads.
Me?
You.
I'm sorry?
You...
You're you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
That's right the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
You have to steal the leads tonight?
What?  What?  The leads.
What?
Yes.  It is George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
He would take you on.  Yes.
He'd give me a job.
Is that what I said?
A job with Graff.
Yes.  Twenty-five hundred apiece.  One night's work and the job with Graff.  Working the premium leads.
However they are that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
For five thousand?
A buck a shot.
What will he pay?
Yes.
What did he say?  He'd buy them.
What did he say?
Is that what I said?
Did you talk to Graff?
Did I say that?
Have I said that?
You're going to steal the leads?
That's right.
You're actually talking about this?
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
Because because you know it's a crime.
We are?
What did you say?
Did you?
No.  Not actually.
You didn't?
Not actually no.
So all this um you didn't actually you didn't go talk to Graff.
Hey.
Well.  Well...
As a robbery.
No.
Talking about it as a...
No.
We're not actually talking about it.
Yes.
As an idea.
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
No we're just...
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this or are we just...
No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
You haven't talked to him.
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
How do you know he'd buy them?
Yes.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
How many leads have we got?
What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey who knows what they're worth what do they pay for them?  All told...must be I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.
What could somebody get for them?
That's what I'm saying.  We were if we were that kind of guys to knock it off and trash the joint it looks like robbery and take the fuckin' leads out of the files...go to Jerry Graff.
Huh.
Someone should rob the office.
What? 
How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.

Something.  To pay them back.  Someone someone should hurt them. Murray and Mitch.

I want to tell you something Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
Mmm.
He told me my share was twenty-five.
Uh-huh?
I...I'm sure he got more than the five actually.
Was it?
It was his idea.
That was easy wasn't it?
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
Who kept the other half?
Five thousand.  I kept half.
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
I sold them to Jerry Graff.
I...
If you tell me where the leads are I won't turn you in.  If you don't I am going to tell the cop you stole them Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
I don't know what you are saying.
What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads we can talk.
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
You robbed the office.
You're so full of shit.
Well I'm saying this Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
Don't fuck with me John don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
No.  It hadn't.
Well hadn't it?
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
How do you know I made it up?
What?
How do you know I made it up?
...excuse me nothing you be as cold as you want but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you then I don't know what if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it he's right.  You're going to make something up be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
Excuse me...
Why I don't...
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
What are you trying to tell me?
Yes I am.
You are?
Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you I'm trying to tell you something.
Mmm.
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
Yes.  I hear you.
You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
Mmm.
On an eighty-thousand dollar day? And it ain't even noon.
It's not impossible.
Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what fire me?
I were you I'd calm down Shelly.
That if the sale sticks it will be a miracle.
What does that fucking mean?
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind they're coming in alright they're very upset I'm trying to make some sense...
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
Did you tell 'em my sale?
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
Get 'em to me!
The leads are coming.
Ah fuck.  Leads!  Leads! Williamson!  Send me out!  Send me out!
Somebody broke in.
What happened?
The deal still stands our other thing.
That's alright.
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which very least that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
Is that what you're saying?
Yeah.  Yeah.
You want something off the B list?
You want to do business that way...? Alright.  Alright.  Alright. Alright.  What is there on the other list...?
Is that it?  Is that it?  You want to do business that way...?
Because I say so.
Why?
I can't split them.
Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.
I have to go... 
I can't do it Shelly...

I'm not sure I have two.
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
What are we going to say?
You start closing again you'll be on the board.
Then put me on the board.
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
Bullshit bullshit you assign them... What are you telling me?
The leads are assigned randomly...
Why?
They all kick out.  You run in streaks pal.  Streaks.  I'm... I'm...don't look at the board look at me.  Shelly Levene.  Anyone. Ask them on Western.  Ask Getz at Homestead.  Go ask Jerry Graff. You know who I am...I NEED A SHOT. I got to get on the fucking board. Ask them.  Ask them.  Ask them who ever picked up a check I was flush. Moss Jerry Graff Mitch himself...Those guys lived on the business I brought in.  They lived on it...and so did Murray John. You were here you'd of benefited from it too.  And now I'm saying this.  Do I want charity?  Do I want pity?  I want sits.  I want leads that don't come right out of a phone book.  Give me a lead hotter than that I'll go in and close it.  Give me a chance. That's all I want.  I'm going to get up on that fucking board and all I want is a chance.  It's a streak and I'm going to turn it around.  I need your help.
...they kicked out.
I've seen those leads.  I saw them when I was at Homestead we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.  They're broke John. They're cold.  They're deadbeats you can't judge on that.  Even so. Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine. Even so.  I go in FOUR FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock.  They're fucking Polacks John.  Four leads.  I close two. Two.  Fifty per...
I'll tell you why I'm out.  I'm out you're giving me toilet paper. John. 
Yes.
I'm out.
Either way.  You're out.
That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...
...ah fuck this...
Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
John.  John...
Murray said...
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now I'm a good man--but I need a...
Murray said...
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
You know what those leads cost?

I want to tell you something.  Your life is your own.  You have a contract with your wife.  You have certain things you do jointly you have a bond there...and there are other things.  Those things are yours.  You needn't feel ashamed you needn't feel that you're being untrue...or that she would abandon you if she knew.  This is your life.  Yes.  Now I want to talk to you because you're obviously upset and that concerns me.  Now let's go. Right now.
She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
Let's...no one's going to know let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
She told me not to talk to you.
What?  What?  What Jim: I tell you what let's get out of here...let's go get a drink.
I can't talk to you you met my wife I...

I can't regotiate.
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky Jim.  Jim anything you want you want it you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no sit down...Now talk to me.

Tell me again.  Your wife.
What's going on here?
Tell me again.
I told you.

It's not me it's my wife.
I'm very sorry Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
I just called downtown and it's on their desk.
The check wasn't cashed?
Today.  Today.  Which in any case it was not as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.
What was the earliest it could have been cashed?
I don't know.
And when was that check cashed?
Tuesday.
What was yesterday?
Yest...
When did you write the check?
If we wait till Mon...
What would have elapsed?
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
No I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
I'm not.
You don't count Saturday.
That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday my time limit runs out.
I don't understand.
Wednesday Thursday Friday.
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
Jim Jim you saw my book...I can't you saw my book...
Of course you have three days.
To change our minds.
No I don't know.  Tell me.
To...you know.
Three days.
I don't know.  They said we have three days.  They said we have three days.
Why did she do that Jim?
I don't know the attorney gen... the...some consumer office um...
Who did she call?
She called the consumer...the attorney I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
Monday.
It's a common reaction Jim.  I'll tell you what it is and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
My wife...
It's funny you know you get a picture of the Corporation-Type Company Man all business...this man no.  We'll go out to his home sometime.  Let's see.  Tomorrow.  No.  Tomorrow I'm in L.A....Monday...I'll take you to lunch where would you like to go?
I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton will you tell them he's on the one o'clock. 
I've got to talk to you...
Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk D. Ray Morton...
I've got to talk to you.
James.  I'm glad to meet you.  I'm glad to meet you James.  I want to show you something.  It might mean nothing to you...and it might not. 
Lingk.  James Lingk.
Well let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma what's yours?
Gimlet.
Money?  If that's what it signifies to you. Security?  Comfort?  All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.  That's all it is.  How are they different?  Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery.  All it is it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us?  We're all different.  We're not the same.  We are not the same.  Hmmm.  It's been a long day.  What are you drinking?
I don't know.  For me I'm saying what is is it's probably not the orgasm.  Some broads forearms on your neck something her eyes did. There was a sound she made...or me lying in the I'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me café au lait.  She gives me a cigarette my balls feel like concrete.  Eh?  What I'm saying what is our life?  It's looking forward or it's looking back.  And that's our life. That's it.  Where is the moment?  And what is it that we're afraid of? Loss.  What else?  The bank closes.  We get sick my wife died on a plane the stock market collapsed...the house burnt down...what of these happen...? None on 'em.  We worry anyway. What does this mean?  I'm not secure.  How can I be secure?  Through amassing wealth beyond all measure?  No.  And what's beyond all measure?  That's a sickness. That's a trap.  There is no measure. Only greed.  How can we act? 
Mmmm...
Yes.
What do I...?
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
I don't know.
Yes.
Did I...?
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it live with it.  You fuck little girls so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?
And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
Have a good trip.
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
Your farewell to the troops?
I'm going home.
What is this your farewell speech?
Who's my pal...?  And what are you Ricky huh what are you Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you Mr. Slick...?  What are you friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
Sittin' on top of the world sittin' on top of the world everything's fucking peachfuzz...
Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...
Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
You have a mean streak in you Ricky you know that...?
It means Dave you haven't closed a good one in a month none of my business you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.
