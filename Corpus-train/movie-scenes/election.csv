Yo --
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals.
I don't need a lecture on ethics Jim okay?  I know what --
That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you nuts?  We talk about girls all the time but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.
You're not just jealous are you?  I mean we both used to talk about her
Dave I'm just saying this as your friend.  What you're doing is really really wrong and you've got to stop.
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
But you haven't written your novel.
Yeah it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
In love?
Look Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy and maybe it did start out you know for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally totally in love.
You did it at your house?  Your own house?
Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place and that could get a little irritating sometimes but basically he was a real good guy.
She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
A few months before the election she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny.
Here get down.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me the me that nobody else knows.
And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness and that price is loneliness.
Thank you.
Tracy I've been watching you for going on two years now and I think you are one of the most talented hard-working sensitive attractive brilliant students -- no human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean you're the real thing.  Special.
What kind of person?
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean well being the kind of person you are it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
No I'm not. I'm just really busy.
Well I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
what?
You know Tracy... I don't know how to say this but...
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student but like two adults.
Well Sherry's great.  But she can be a little much sometimes.
What?
Yeah. No. I mean you know.
You guys have fun?
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
How'd it go?
Do it!
Yeah just --
Come on doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on fill me up
Yeah uh just a minute
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
He likes it.
Jim don't.  You're scaring him.
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
Everything's fine.  Just you know school.
Anything wrong?
Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend my source of love and strength. Oh sure we'd had our share of bumpy times but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication.
So nice
All right.  Well sure nice to meet you.
Dick.
Having a problem with your eye there?
You're going to Catholic school next year.  You're going to Sacred Heart. Maybe they'll straighten you out!
Tammy  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
What?
Dick... Dick..
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
But Mr. M. -
Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly and we still have to do counts for VP Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
It happens Larry. People make mistakes.
But they were there I counted 803 votes.
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
See it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
Mostly Tammy fans
I think we've got a problem.
Yeah?
Larry?
Huh.  Okay.  Well I guess I'd better do my count.
Mr. M.?
Larry we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won.
I thought those were the rules Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
You're kidding right?
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
What d'you got?
All right.  I'll be back
Okay.  Yeah.  We know
I just want to get this over with so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on too you know.
You have the key Mr. McAllister.
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president and I'll be right back.
Well I thought that... well the way it always works is that SGA president does a count then the SGA advisor you know for the two independent counts.
What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
You will.
I hope so
You'll be fine.
I'm scared Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
Take as much room as you want
What a surprise.
Would you sign it for me?
Oh is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
I just have to get something. I'll be right back.
Swallows unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
I want you to do something for me.
My house.
What's this?
I've got an idea.
Well I... I... that's very nice of you.
Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought well I'm going away soon and you'll be stuck here and I don't know I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been well friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
Doing what?
Why are you doing this?
Yes?
So Tracy?
That sounds good.
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
Uh-huh.
Plenty of pep too.
Yeah.
Handles pretty good don't you think?
Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
Where to?
Sporty.
So are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
Good for you.  Good for you
Well I got in everywhere I applied but Cornell is my first choice.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well you came to the right place
I'm looking at new cars.
So what brings you here?
Hello Tracy.
Hello Mr. M.
That said the whole point of an election is to choose winners and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.
Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.
That's enough Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?
I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
What do you mean?
Looks like today's your lucky day
Yes?
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations and chances to win certain elections.
I don't know what you're referring to but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy everything would be okay.
This isn't the time or the place to get into it but there is for just one example a certain former colleague of mine who made a very big mistake a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that old and young we ail make mistakes and we have to learn that our actions all of them can carry serious consequences.  You're very young Tracy underage in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
Why are you lecturing me?
You're a very intelligent girl Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead and yes stepping on people to get there well there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end you're only cheating yourself.
well I don't know.  It could have been anybody.  There are a lot of you know subversive elements around Millard.  You know like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken - what about him?  Or what about Tammy Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know instead of wasting time interrogating me we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early around 6:30.
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
Mr. M. I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to you know to vandalism like a you know... Plus my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting because I think you did it.
If it's about the posters I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
I guess you know why you're here
Look why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow everybody'll make their speeches and I'm sure everything will be fine.
Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
Looks like Tim Kobza.
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one I can't even read this one.
As far as I know they--
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
Calm down Tracy.  Just calm down.
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
So like I was saying things were going pretty well in my life.
Fuck me Mr. McAllister
Good luck Tracy.
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Sure
You know Mr. M. when I win the presidency that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
Yeah.  Okay.  well good luck Tracy
Hell you know Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
You bet.
Thanks for everything.
Okay fine. Sure
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
NO that's fine
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
Looks good to me.
Right
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away you know in the morning.
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
Here they are.
Hey that's super
I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Now at the end of her junior year Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
Ethics are...
Tracy.
I know.
Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
Thanks Mr. M.
Well good luck there Tracy
Yes I do.
You know what they say about the early bird.
Not wasting any time are you Tracy?
Good morning Mr. McAllister.
Oh yeah you bet.
Well that speech she gave -- it was pretty you know pretty out there.  But we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that.  Right Jim?
Even tried you at home.  We've got a situation here.
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Jim where the hell have you been?
Yeah... whatever.  All I know is she's a troublemaker.  She's on my list.
Walt we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished you hear me? Washed up.
Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.
Okay Jim. I understand.
Walt will be speaking with you about this but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
Oh.  Okay.
Walt needs to see you.
Hmm?
Uh Jim?
Life would go on and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
I have proof.
I don't believe you.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
Which door?
Door was open.
And how did you get in the school?
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
Exactly when?
This weekend.
And when did you do it?
I did it.
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
What is it. Tammy?
Well this is hard for me but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
So... what do you have to tell me?
Okay.  Because I know who did it.  So.. I'll just be outside.
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
Just wait outside. Tammy.
You wanted to see me Mr. M.?
Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --
I was lonely.  You took advantage
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
Sherry... I love you.
Yeah.  I'm here.
You're there.
What do you want Jim?
Three twenty-five.
Three twenty-five.
Easy tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
Right now?
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
Hey Yeah?
We'll let it run awhile
Yep.
Still clear?
All his life.  He's tried everything.
No I... uh didn't know that
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
Dave.
Shall we give it a name?
Oh.
points at the motel.
Should we get a what?
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
You sure?
Oh come on.  You've had a hard year you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
I can't afford this stuff right now.
Okay.  Give me the drill.
More this way.
Here?
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
Sure.
Could you get this? I can't
Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
After Dave got fired Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
Just one more thing.  So Mr. M. uh do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
Oh okay.  Yeah sorry.
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well you know how last year's theme was -
Why don't you guys go sit down okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.
Oh no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here and I've got to get home.
Exactly.  So what do you say?  Maybe it's time to give a little something back.
I also like bananas.
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
No wait -- apples.  Apples.
Okay let's say
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
Paul what's your favorite fruit?
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy doesn't it? That's more like a... well like a dictatorship like we studied.
And she's super-nice
Yeah no she's a go-getter all right.
Who me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff Mr. M. Besides that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
Let me give you a clue.  You're a born leader.  You're one of the most popular students at Millard.  You're honest and straightforward.  You don't choke under pressure as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside.  The other kids look up to you.  What does that spell?
What do you mean?
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
Yeah.
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
Paul I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
Larry you just take it easy
You said I was a liar   You're the liar you're the --
I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks every vote was accounted for.
Whoa! Easy Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
If you say so.
