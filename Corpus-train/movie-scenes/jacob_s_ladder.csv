No! Oh God.
No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain.  Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family!
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
Let me out of here!
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
I'm alive.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
Take me home.
Get me out of here.
Like Della.
Well how do I look?
Just to see you. That's all.
What do you want?
I see.
You want to see me? Well here I am.
Della?
Hiya Jake. That was some dance.
It's fun.
No thanks.
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
No don't. But thanks.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
I'm okay.
Are you all right?
Hello Sam.
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
Me too.
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right Jake. I'm game.
You know I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
Grass never did that to me.
Yeah ever since that ...
Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?
Hey you're talkin' about Paul. Who'd want to hurt him?
How do you know?
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
LET GO!
What do you want from me?
Daddy. Let go.
Stop!!!!
You're hurting me!
Oh God!
Daddy!
Just my luck.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Oh terrific.
Short? It's ended.
It's short huh?
You know you got a strange line here.
You see this line here? It's your life line. Here's where you were born. And this is where you got married. You're a married man huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.
I could have told you that.
You have an unusual hand.
Don't bother to call again okay?
Hey wait!
I'm hanging up.
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
Listen Jake. I gotta go.
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Maybe the demons are real.
What are you talking about?
Maybe there's a larger truth.
What do you mean?
Maybe it's not the army Jake.
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
They're not interested Jake.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
There's nothing to expose.
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us Frank. We have to expose this.
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
Well try huh.
It's hard to explain.
What does that mean Frank? I don't get it. Why?
That's right. We did.
Listen I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
Hello.
He was upset. He thought people were following him.
What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything?
Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here Gabe.  Come on go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
Don't go.
Now what?
Wait ... Daddy.
Mom it's ...
Tell your mother.
It's cold.
It was the window.
There was a bang.
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
Daddy what was that noise?
I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch okay?
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
It means that you and your buddies are whacko that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
Used you?
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for but you have used and abused me and I don't like it.
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
You mind? I'm eating huh?
A doctor? And what's he gonna do tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something.
You need ... a doctor.
Listen will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.
Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you huh?
Ah! Well then they're going to have to pay for that aren't they?
I'm too messed up to teach.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
I am.
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
Doctor.  Ph.D.
Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here?
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
This isn't injustice Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
I'm sorry Mr. Singer but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
What else did he say Jake?
What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange huh? Strange.
That was set. I'm tellin' you.
But the paper ...
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
Why do you say that?
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
You think they're connected?
Excuse me a minute. I'll be right back.
No. Not really ...
He say what they looked like?
A couple of weeks I think.
How long had that been going on?
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him he said.
He told me he was going to Hell.
What do you mean demons?
I say you should get a shrink.
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
Not my head buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides six heads'll be better than one.
Come on Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
Okay not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man we need to find out what's going on.
Not me buddy.
An explosion just like Paul's.
Dr. Carlson's dead?
Shit!
... I've seen them too.
It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened happened. It's over.
Not tonight Louis. No more rest.
Jake you need to rest.
I'm walking aren't I?
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
There's something I've gotta take care of Louis.
What are you doing?
You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.
What? By myself?
Perfect. We got it.  Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.
You ever read Meister Eckart?  How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart?  Good. Okay let's turn over gently. Right side.
I've seen it. It's all pain.
Well I'll see what I can do about it.
I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die Louis.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
Am I dead Louis?  Am I dead?
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well you've done it to yourself this time haven't you?
I know.
Louis you're a life saver.
Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
I don't know. I've been having them recently.  You know you look like an angel Louis an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
What?
I had this weird flash just then.
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
God almighty. What did you do to me?
Wiggle your toes.
I can't relax.
If it was any other brain but yours I might agree. Relax this is going to be strong.
What can I tell you Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
What? She threw me out remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
You should go back to her.
She hates me Louis.
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love Jake.
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
She didn't. That's about all she said. Put your hand up. Good. I think she still loves you. Take a breath and let it out.
I thought you said she didn't say much.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
She talk about the boys?
Ah good. Now turn to your left.
Not much. She's like you that way. Two clams. No wonder your marriage didn't last. Put your hand under your head. Take a breath and then let it out.
Sarah.
Who?
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
What did she have to say?
A bit.
Her knee acting up?
I saw Sarah the other day.
What can I tell you?
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
How do you know?
Come on Jake. That didn't hurt.
Hell you think I am?
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
But I see them.
Jacob I don't believe in demons not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
I'm afraid Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem Jacob is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
I need your insight your intuition.
I don't know what to say.
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
Christ I know how it sounds.
I see them Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.
I know very little about demons Ja- cob fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures biblical ones ... Dante Milton ... but Jacob  this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.
Yes.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
No.  I see them.
Demons Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
I've got a problem Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard if you know what I mean.  I need to know about ... demons.
Well try not to get burned. You have a great mind Jacob. Don't let anyone tempt you away from it.
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof she's a fiery lady.
Jacob if it was any other brain but yours I might agree.  Tell me does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
Oh that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
Oh you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates that's all.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office Midtown 34th Street branch.
Ah!
I haven't seen her in months.
And how is your wife? Sarah no?
Likewise.
It's good to see you.
Ah. Neither snow nor sleet nor dark of night ... I always admired that.
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
Are you in the service?
Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
Whataya mean no record?
I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
Jacob Singer.
What's your name?
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
Look I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
New? He's been here for years.
Carlson? Is he new here?
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson please.
Save me!
Jacob what can I do?
No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
Go to sleep.
She was good in bed though.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me even in your mind?
Jezebel from the post office. You remember you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
I don't want to know.
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
It's not healthy with it closed.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you Sarah if you want to sleep with fresh air you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
I'm not cold.
It's freezing.
What was that?
Goddamn it. I want Louis.
I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
No. Don't move me.
I'm going to have to move you a bit just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
Who did?
They stole it.
Your back? Did you fall?
My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
You know who I am.
TELL ME DAMN YOU!
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
WHO ARE YOU?
I loved your chemist Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
Goddamn you!
What's wrong Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Oh God!
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable Dr. Singer.
This isn't happening.
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
Where have they gone?
It's over Jake. It's all over.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Sit down!
Where are they?
Sit down Jake.
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Stop it Jez. Don't do that.
I always liked the West west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Don't be funny.
Where's West? New Jersey?
West.
Oh?  Where you going?
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning Jez.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
Mid-town mostly.
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Then don't bug me.
You can have anything you want.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
I'm tired.
Jake what is it?
I'm not upset.
You look upset.
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey what's wrong? Are you all right?
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well I've had it. You flip out on your own you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you you hear? Nothing!
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
You know goddamn well what I mean.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
You've lived with me for two years.
I don't know you.
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
Why won't you answer me?
Hold me Jezzie. Hold me.
It's going to be all right Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
With wings.  You transport me you know that? You carry me away.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
TELL ME DAMN YOU!
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
WHO ARE YOU?
You have quite a mind Jake. I loved your friends. That chemist - the Ladder. What an imagination you have!
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
What's wrong Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable Dr. Singer.
What's going on?
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
Where have they gone?
It's over Jake. It's all over.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Sit down.
Where are they?
Sit down Jake.
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Oh yeah?  Try leavin' without me.
I love you when you're angry.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
No. I'm a marked man Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
Please.
I promise.
Bullshit!
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
I can waitress. I'm good.
It's not practical Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
I want to go with you Jake. Wherever you go.
Stick with me kid.
This is one of my dreams Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
It's so hard to believe.
I tell you it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise Jezzie.
It's amazing you know that a drug could change things like that destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
What's gotten into you?
Me neither.
God I can't keep up with all your changes.
Yep. Finally. I love you Jez.
Are you out of your mind?
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you Jake. I dodged people all over the place reporters police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
How do you know he's telling the truth?
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
How?
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
Who was that?
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
It might be for me.
Don't!
I can do anything I want.
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
I want to know. You tell me!
Stay away from me Jez.
Where were you Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
Let go!
Who else were you expecting?
Jezzie?
It's just me.
Baby I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight.  Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something.
I don't believe this.
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out he said.
What's he talking about?
He said you didn't have one.
What? What do you mean?
He didn't give me a chance.  Look honey don't get upset but he's not taking your case.
Why didn't you call me?
While you were in the shower.
He did? When?
I put a frozen dinner in the oven a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh and Jake your lawyer called.
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something Jez honestly ... I thought they were real.
How come? The army?
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
Remember that.
Underneath all the bullshit just love.
I know.
I love you Jez.
We're all angels you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
With wings. You transport me you know that? You carry me away.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
Look I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
What?
You know you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
You're right here Jake. You just rest.  The doctor said you had a virus. That's what they say when they don't know what it is. You can't do anything for a week. He says you gotta recuperate.  Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken soup. It'll warm you up.
Are we in Brooklyn?
What's in here?
Jake you are never out of your head!
I must have been out of my head.
The best.
And look what I got.
A good lay.
Yeah but for what?
You sold your soul remember? That's what you told me.
You're a real heathen you know that Jezzie? Jesus how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
I don't let anybody call me that.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
Well personally I never went for church names.
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
They're weird names.
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
No. The little one.
Who? Jed?
Your kid dropped it off.
Thanks.  What's that?
Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
Jezzie I can't see.
Did you look around the headboard?
I don't know.
Where'd you leave 'em?
No. Have you seen my glasses?
You up?
Don't ask.
What happened to you?
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides it's double time.
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
Oh God Jezzie ask me tomorrow.
The room!
What do you mean?
What do you think?
Thanks.
That help?
Where to?
I moved the couch. That's all.
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
Where are you?
Where is the lamp?
Gee thanks a lot.
I didn't want to wake you.
Why didn't you turn on the light?
What the hell did you do move all the furniture?
Jake is that you?
Save the words ... Just send back my credit card.
I don't know what to say.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
No. I couldn't.
Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
I would have stayed there if I could.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
Mike it was real. It was glorious.
Well that's good to know.
It was paradise Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
Better living through chemistry that's my motto.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle Michael. A miracle.
And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.
What's happening? Help me.
Just relax.
I can't move.
Pleasant dreams.
I think I'm falling asleep.
It's strong stuff.
One drop?
