MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99
You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me you don't even know who you are.
Whatever gets you off.
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
Should I wear it?
That's it.
That's it?
Just loud enough to wake me up.
Slam it?
It's simple you just go to the bathroom.
Well what then?
A cop?
Yeah but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
That's right I did didn't I?
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
Yeah?
Leonard it's Burt from the front desk.
Hi Leonard.
I'm sorry I think I'm checked in here but I've misplaced my key.
Leonard.
You don't have to be that honest Burt.
Yeah well you're not gonna remember anyway.
Well at least you're being honest about cheating me.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
You're still paying for it. It's still Your room.
Business is slow. I told my boss about You about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
Why?
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
When was I in here?
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.

No let's go.
This isn't my room?
This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.

Shit. Wrong room.
Hi Leonard.

He's not my friend Burt. But if he calls or if he turns up here then you give me a call in my room okay?
Seen you together that's all.
What makes you think he's my friend?
As requested.
So you're holding my calls?
Couple days.
How long have I been here?
What's it like?
My wife.
No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude that's probably...
Amnesia?
I have no memory.
Condition?
That's the thing. I have this condition.
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
You don't know?

About your whore of a wife?
Don't say another fucking word!
Shut the fuck up!
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue you fucking retard.
Yes.
Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared can you get angry?!
Just take it easy this isn't my fault.
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared you don't remember how you fucking idiot!
Calm down.
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
Don't talk about my wife.
That's different.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife right?
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
Kill him. I'll pay you.
What?
Get rid of Dodd for me.
How?
Help me.
I'm not.
Don't protect him.
Neither do I.
What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
What happened?
I have this condition -
You don't know do you? You're blissfully ignorant aren't you?
What's this all about?
No!
Did you?
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
What does he want?
Calls himself Dodd.
Who?
Somebody's come. Already.
What's wrong?
He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
Why would you do that?
I told him about your car.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
This guy's dangerous let's think of something else.
Yeah I hated it.
Yeah?
My wife used to call me Lenny.
He'll kill you Lenny.
Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
And? 
I'll go see him.
What are you gonna do?
Where is he?
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
And what did he say?
Who?! Fuck Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
Who?
Kill him.
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
What do the police think?
Who did he go to meet?
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
What happened?
His name was Jimmy.
Just relax.
It's not easy to be calm when -
She's gone and the present is trivia which I can scribble down as notes.
Your wife?
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge but it's a kind of memory a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world  and I know her.
Such as?
There are things you know for sure.
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything you can never know anything for sure.
Course not.
Kill him.
What?
Did you?
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
Yes.
So I just take your word?
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
How do I know he did that to you?
Leonard you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me.
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
Who is he? What have you got me into?
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
Yeah. You?
Sleep okay?
You know what we have in common?
Don't remember.
They treating you alright?
Sorry.
I wasn't helping you for money.
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
It's isolated.
Deals?
I wrote an address in there too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
Why?
Tell me about her again.
But even if you get your revenge you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
Yes.
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
You know him?
Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list you'll be eating your underwear.
Yes.
Is that what your little note says?
So you have information for me?
Yeah.
You told me.
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
You did explain Lenny.
Sorry I should have explained. You see I have this condition -
You don't remember me.
She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her.
Thank you.
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
Mrs. Jankis what do you want from me?
Then why are you here?
I'm not appealing the decision.
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
I'm not interested in the company position Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
Mr. Shelby you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you I enjoy it. Just let me read please.
Yeah but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
I enjoy it.
You've read it a hundred times.
It's good.
How can you read that again?
You can't just take it!
It is now.
Your name's Teddy.
When it's done I'll know! It'll be different!
You won't remember!
Somehow I'll know!
No you won't.
Yes I will.
Are you sure?
My wife wasn't diabetic.
Sammy didn't have a wife.
I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and -
You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
That's Sammy not me! I told you about Sammy -
I dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.. the insulin -
What the fuck are you talking about?
This is a drug deal?!
Well I hope it's not as serious as his 'cos this guy's dead.
I don't know. See I have this condition.
Maybe. Maybe just.
No. Don't worry I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
He might have fallen down the stairs I don't know I don't know what's going on I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?
There's a guy in here hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
What's wrong?
You're not coming?
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
How do you know him?
'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
How do you know this?
Why not?
Why? Come on Leonard we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
Why?
The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
How'd you know I was in here?
Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town. 
Yeah well thanks for the advice.
I know you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
I didn't sell -
That's who you were Lenny. You don't know who you are who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
Yes I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby I'm from San Fran -
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance we were well covered.
I have money.
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
Like what?
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
What sort of questions?
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
Why?
I won't be happy until you leave town.
Happy now?
I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation so when she offers to help you it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen write yourself a note do not trust her.
Why are you following me?
She has no idea who I am.
Why not?  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
She couldn't.
Yeah well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
From who?
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
She's involved with these drug dealers.
Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her for fuck's sake. 
Why's that?
Who's she?
Lenny as a buddy let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
Unfinished business.
Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
Prove it.
Teddy. Your buddy.
Who the fuck are you?
Natalie who?
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
So what are you gonna do now?
You like it? Let's trade.
What's wrong with this one?
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
So was he scared?
Give me your keys.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
Easy for you to say you've got the Jag.
Shut it Teddy.
We probably ought to take his car you know teach him a lesson.
Fucking hope not.
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
I don't know.
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
He's got to have a car right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
We've got to get him out of here.
Why?
Natalie? Natalie who?
No. No just let me think for a minute.
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy if that's what -
I might have fallen asleep before I did.
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
I don't think so.
No! Should I?
You don't know him?
You called me. You wanted my help. You know Lenny I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
Why are you here?
Probably left it in your room.
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
You're living.
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
You really want to find this guy?
Why?
Lenny you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
Yeah well I go on facts not recommendations okay?
Well the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
Why?
The guy you're looking for Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
Who?
Yeah yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here right?
It's weird but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten so I always just eat small amounts.
Only every time I see ya! Come on I'll buy you lunch.
Guess I've told you about my condition.
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
Things change.
You said you were leaving town.
Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back?
Lenny it's Teddy. Look stay there okay? I'm gonna be right over.
John Gammell?
Lenny is that you?
Mr Gammell?
Yup?
I don't remember.
You know it?
What the hell you want to go there for?
You're in a playful mood.
This is your car.
I guess I've told you about my condition.
Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
Shut your mouth!
That's who you were you don't know who you are.
I'm Leonard Shelby I'm from San Francisco and I'm -
Teddy!
Leonard you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
Why would I have a gun?
