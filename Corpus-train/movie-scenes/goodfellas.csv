No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
But he was always a bad kid that one.
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
What? What happened?
Look at Jeannie's kid.
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We're only kidding. You can't take a joke? Come ooonn.
No more shines Billy.
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls I'd send you home for your shine box.
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
