The bearded guy the creep. Oh one other thing. Testa if that's his name he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Testa?
To be honest when I'm working I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
Besides that.
Um... he was older.
Was this him?
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
...well there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work educate the public but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest Seattle. You know when they say stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild or lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent Koessler administrative I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
No.
Have you had a chance to think about --
The diner?
No sir.
Anybody talk to the press?
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Agents Duncan Mackelway.  Anything new?
I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
Agent Duncan there's an interstate issue up on 54 run out there.
Yeah.
Takes four days to chill then its time to come back.  Is that...?
Welcome back sir. How was the vacation?
Winona.
I want the autopsy report where is it Minnesota?
She's buried.
You have the body?
Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
What?
You heard?
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
Hi there.
Sheriff Dylan this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
Dylan here.
Got a sister like this what they call it anal? That's her.
Tape it off we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in pays picks up the key but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Show's over boys. Nobody home.
And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night.  Eddie we're walking in. Everything covered?
The room key's in the car. On the seat.
Let's take a look.
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo cash; since then nothing -- no activity no phone response.
What does the Manager say?
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset the no-tell motel Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
Hey Sheriff.
I'm on my way.
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
You tell me.
What's the bad news?
Oh Jesus Sheriff I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
Mack this is Sheriff Dylan.
Agent Mackelway.
I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
This isn't in our database?
Who knows.
You're thinking...?
Her name is Karen Sumpter from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
I know how the Feds like to sit on information. I got something in the car to show you.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
Nine bodies in Roswell now this -- it's getting a little hairy huh?
That's right Jan.
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you from personal experience the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
Well the victim was killed at the turn-around over there then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace he's out of Alamogordo.
Excuse me a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Fella's name is Harold Speck travelin' man out of Roswell.
You run the plates?
We need to run this through VICAP search for similar burns.
A grill pattern.
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report yes here.  These burn marks.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing the search her body found the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
That's the thing. Don't know if it connects but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out another punctured. Took polaroids after.
Ripped off. By hand my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time there's blood on his throat.
This is Agent Mackelway.
Be my guest Agent Kulok scrub suits are in the back.
I appreciate it doctor. You know how it is press screaming for answers Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
Ligature strangulation just like his victims. A cord nylon you can tell by the indentation signature -- again like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
Not as much as you'd think.
Oh yes I see. You must get asked this a lot.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
Mam it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
I have 6 tons.
Not a discrepancy an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons not 6.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
Why me? What do you want from me!?
I've been looking for you.
What do you want from me?
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
Oh God mister please leave me alone.
Calm down Harold.  Okay here's what we're going to do Harold: there's a pull off up ahead we're going to stop there.
What's wrong with me?
You're a... you're sick.
Not bad huh?
My God.
Take a look Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look don't you?
Look mister...
Fucking. I'm talking about fucking Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
What are you...?
You know you ever think about other women?
Excuse me?
You must get lonely. You ever think about you know... 
Look...
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
What?
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
I don't mean to be rude but...
Whole country or just hereabouts?
Yeah.
You must travel a lot huh?
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
You... surprised me.
Hi. What's in the case?
Jesus.
Put a BOLO out on that.
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue side door with brown you know primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah yeah a Ford.
What kind?
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
He was sitting here?
He had an orange hat on.
How did you know he was a construction worker?
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so white regular build needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
What did he look like?
Yes.
The man who was with him he was a construction worker?
This could all be a coincidence but you know something I don't believe in coincidences. That's why I came back.  Do you think the UNSUB -- we're not going to mention the word Zorro -- met Harold Speck online?
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
He said it was a clue?
Let's take a look at it.  Drop off my stuff at the hotel after you're done here.
At the field office.
You have the photo from the diner?
What's with the eyelids?
Nada. Vague description that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car the diner: no fingerprints no trace evidence.
What about his killer?
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
Just step outside sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Mackelway I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature but you Agent Kulok you had a shining career in front of you.
Please.
What are you doing?
Deputy Director get out sir.
Serial killer killed. In Ft. Myers. Cut up in his van. And this time we got a witness.
Another what?
We have another one.
What?
Sorry to interrupt you sir but I thought you'd like to know.
Smarter than us.
Maybe cause he's smart.
We didn't know Speck was a serial the police didn't know his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
Just an observer.
Chuck hello.  This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.
You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
Dick Low's a killer too.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
Hawkins isn't the target Richard Low's the target.
What about Zero Darryl Hawkins?
We'll wait. Get online with Low inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
As far as the public knows Richard Low is dead. And he will stay dead until we kill him.
I understand.
Watch out for Dick Low he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle not unlike you an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene beat him up force a confession -- all unauthorized all illegal.  The Agent died that night killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all we had to hush it up let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon the second man Richard killed.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else sir.
There was talk of a file photo.
I didn't use Low's name.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
I was looking for a pattern.
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso Ft. Myers Omaha the Murman murder time frames.
An oversight sir I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
I was visiting an old college friend.
Why did you go to Chicago?
I want to catch Dick Low more than you can imagine but I cannot risk going public. What happens when the media finds out that a former FBI Special Agent a founder of the Behavioral Sciences Unit is not dead but instead alive and killing people not ordinary people but even worse serial killers making him some sort of white knight vigilante?  You keep at it. We'll find him we'll find him in our own way.
Huh? sir.
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
Collected shoes too?
It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him.
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
I suspected but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look whatever Daitz told you nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did the trick is not to get too close.
How long ago?
Dunlevy said there was another case Ron Rice. In fact there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
You suspected all along suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We the Director and I decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also over the years I admit taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
I'm hesitant to...
I don't believe this.
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well nothing.
Okay Harold Speck: who goes first?
Had trouble sleeping last night sir.
You feeling okay Agent Mackelway?
They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on.
I always meant to ask what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
What I do requires confidentiality.
I'll take it into consideration.
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes perhaps Agent Kulok?
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
This time sir if I may be so bold would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
Agent Mackelway you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
Go ahead.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
No just coincidence. He knew who I was of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?
Do you think he singled you out?
He got away. I had him. He got away.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
Pretty embarrassed to be honest. I had him.
How do you feel Agent
Then why do I still have a badge?
Its called insubordination.
I was lucky to find much less crack the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room spook these guys with stupid questions blow my cover? -- no way.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
I might point out Agent Mackelway the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
I'll relay this to CIIAC.
MyDick.
From the grave?
Speck. Harold Speck.
Who?
I think I talked to him.
This better be important.
Look sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
You have to save this boy. Good exists in this world. I can prove it because you can in your life save this one person.
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
Agent Kulok that boy as we speak is in Hawkins' truck probably still alive in a dark refrigerated compartment shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind freezing terrified wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place desperate imagining the worst is happening as she pleads back there at the rest stop for someone anyone to listen to her. This is not hypothetical this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.
Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story always a story any goddamn story to save his ass.
When I was at the rest stop there was a young boy maybe ten and his mother. Darryl Hawkins Zero abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
Suspect Zero now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
You are so fucked up.
How did a girl like me end up in a place like this?  The Deputy Director here he believes in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up or ship out righto? Agent Kulok when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials. You'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers some years ago. That's a Dave Koessler trick find a pliant sociopath preferably a dead one attribute to him unsolved cases clean up the backlog-looks great in the yearly report.
You're a disgrace to law enforcement to the Bureau -- and to me.
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day David you might break your nose.
Don't you touch him.
Thank you Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
Miss me Dave?
I'm going to Amarillo.
What happened?
Get the routes of all refrigerated trucks over the last ten years. We've got three disappearance cities and dates three parallel discovery cities. Get into the mainframe let it crunch this information.
How are we going to find him?
Zero abducts victims all over the country kills them keeps them refrigerated for days weeks even months then buries them hundreds thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero we'll find boneyards all across the country.
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
Jaime --
I've got to take a piss.
I...
I haven't changed anything.  Damn.
It's quite advanced.
What's going on?
Yeah of course.
You okay?
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
Tom you okay?
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry Mack but I don't think this is the answer.
But why this pattern?
Mack I'm just trying to keep up with now.
Jaime do you think when this is all over when we're in different divisions you think maybe you and me we could try again?
I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry I've cleared it.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
They say Richard Low is wrong but because of him women innocent women are alive who would be dead.
It's okay to be wrong just don't be dead wrong.
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right but not all of us.
I'd be real careful if I were you.
I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report kept it secret.
Does one exist?
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
And you're working with him?
You were right. He found me.
Slow down a second you met with Low --
I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
What's going on?
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero you'll find Low.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
Suspect Zero.
Start killing people for real?
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.
What's up?
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
Jaime? Where are you?
Hello?
I just need to go a little slow.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
That's my point. Remember you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
Not the way I can.
And nobody else can do that?
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
You need time to think. About the case about you and me.
What's that?
Then there's the other issue.
That's true.
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
Oh.
No I mean maybe we should back off a bit you and me.
I can't. They trust me they accept me. I've got their confidence.
Maybe we should back off a bit.
You did.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
No Jaime I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
Mack I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies voyeurism mutilation teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other Mack they're trading souvenirs.
You mean --
Sue Ann Hanson.
The tattoo?
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa found her last Spring. This one --
Jesus.
We did find these however.
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
No. Cut off while he was still alive look at his wrists damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately he'd soundproofed his van.
Find the feet?
Not yet. Not about this either.
Not about coming to see Daitz?
Just routine stuff.
What did you tell him?
He's called a couple times.
Does Koessler ask about me?
I've been thinking about this.
I know.
It's a no-no.
There are Agency regulations about this.
Oh yeah I forgot.
Because you asked him to stupid.
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
No Mack I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
You must really think I'm a square a computer nerd.
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
Huh?
I saw him on a talk show once talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims not the families of the victims he doesn't talk about them. Blood money that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
Don't be too harsh.
I ever get like that just take me out in back and shoot me.
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
I was thinking maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away I told them who to look for but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her.
My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies what turns him on what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
What's this country coming to?
He thinks he looks young.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
Look at this fellow... or this one.
Sex.
What's that?
And one other thing.
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
I was going to be a physician I am a physician but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not but they do: occupations define us.
You got a point there.
Taking a Stryker saw cutting off the top of someone's cranium pulling the brain out -- what's that a day in Spring?
This is some serious shit.
No no no most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room listened in I started to think some might actually be real that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
They're all criminals?
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community walk their walk talk their talk gain their confidence.
You want to have dinner?
The other reason?
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
I don't carry it with me.
Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off think things through.  Where's the file?
So you went underground?
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
Suspect Zero?
I'm not sure exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys every one of them. I got obsessive.
What was your weakness sir?
He always had a weakness in that area. I saw it the first time I met him. We all had our weaknesses I guess. Daitz wanted the money. With Dave it was the glory. Koessler saw the Behavioral Sciences Unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things. He had his eye on the Director's job even then. Catching killers was a means to an end for them.
He's moved on to TV.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
I've been reading hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler Professor Daitz.
How's the arm?
I believe it is you sir who has us jumping through hoops.
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
When you exit head east on 10th.
Yes sir.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
Yes.
Agent Mackelway?
I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy figure it out.
Who are you?
The little piggie speaks.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
Leave this room I'll go back with you blow your cover.
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
I want to go live with you.
[What does the file say?]
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
[You tell me.]
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
[Not the heart the watch.]
I want to help you.
[Hello Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
Let's talk about Zero.
Let's go someplace private Murman I have something for you.
[If you wanted a good steak you should have gone to Omaha.]
[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
Haven't had any but I'm willing to try.
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
If I owe I will go.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
I've been to Chicago.
[Follow me.]
Lead the way Murman.
[You want to talk Lionheart or you want to take this a little more personal?]
Something came up Murman my man.
[Lionheart what happened?]
Whatever happened to MyDick?
[Reality very risky.]
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
[Fantasy time girls give it up give it up.]
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
What is it exactly I don't understand Agent Mackelway?
I don't think you understand.
This man Hawkins has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero.
Excuse me Agent Mackelway?
Locate a jet we're going to Amarillo.
Now Mr. Hawkins when last in Amarillo where did you get gas?
350 miles.
How far is Amarillo?
He wants us to know he's out there what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck he wants us to know he did it.
But why attack an Agent?
I talked to him.
Speck is dead.
I don't...
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
No.
The same.
Koessler?
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
Got a vehicle?  Head north on 54. When you get to New Mexico you've gone too far.
Yes sir.
Agent Mackelway you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
Jesus just what I need another blue flamer.  Johnny get this boy some sun screen.
I like working for the Bureau sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean you're not going to get promoted not wearing this jacket.
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
Four hundred and sixty sir.
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
I screwed up twice sir.
Sounds like fun.
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector sir.
Hot enough for you Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Thomas Mackelway.
Johnny get this man's file. Mackelway right?
I believe it's in my file sir.
What did you do to end up here?
Yes sir.
So you're the new meat?
Good morning sir. Agent Salinas sir.
Take your shirt off.
It's over for you.
Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms swapped goodies: pictures panties jewelry body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls oh yeah harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
Murman!
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
