Well you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder but her memory of it is gone at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
So she did witness it?
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
Could I have that in American?
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
How is she?
C'mon Betty open up! I got some questions for you about...
Sheriff I don't...
I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
GODAMMIT BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
BETTY I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
Oh right... 's fine. Thanks.
...I meant your food.
Oh you know the usual... keeping the world safe.
Hey Sheriff. How's everything?
I've got the working gun Elden me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there.
No no no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
You wanna see if he has more shells go ahead. I say we wait...
You gotta go we're pinned down!
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
We need ammo... Go check his jacket I'll cover you.
YOU shut up!  They're beautiful but get them some water.
We're in a shootout Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
-- small-time pissant Barney Fife --
Fuck you Roy Ostrey!
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
I know plenty.
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing but... what else do you know?
Uh-huh.  Anyway I'm thinking Easter 'cause I just fucking love pastels.
'Kay good. Bye then...
Oh yeah he's got things up and running alright...
Hmm.  So Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
You must be joking.
They're fine... you miss it?
I dunno. Job satisfaction I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
Oh. How come?
Great. Good. Content...
No I was just... How you doing?
Need something else?
Uhh no we haven't picked a date yet... well once he dumps her we will.  He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
I don't think I am.
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me but I insisted...  I have to ask you Betty...are you crazy?
I wouldn't have put it quite that way but...
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
Yes... Not the actor though the doctor. I think.
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
When a Roman general knew a battle was lost he'd throw himself on his sword.
...what're you saying?
Betty I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
I'd rather not...
Ahh it's too late anyway. It's too late.  Listen I could shoot my way out maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
This is really awkward...
Wait Betty... you still haven't answered me.
I better go check on them.
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
I'm sorry.
That's my son! My son is dead!
Yes but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity or something.
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry they're fine...  Look I used to feel that same way said practically those same words sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country Betty and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
I don't feel that no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
Well thirty-three but I'm not counting Del on account of you... so what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony walks in the rain sunsets animals and children. I read passionately and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit excuse my language.
Umm I don't think that...
I'm appreciably older than you but my health is good. I take care of myself and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself and you don't even realize it.
I am?
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash mostly people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
...to see you.
...well if you're not going to slit my throat why'd you come up here?
Damn life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it.
Drugs? God no! I'm totally against drugs.
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs Betty?
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing did you?
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me so kill me. You want me to be afraid but I'm not. I don't care who you are or why you two killed my husband...
Do you know why I'm here?
...I... I know what you are.
Do you know who I am?
No just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
Oh this is wonderful...
This is Roy Ostrey he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
Who are these idiots?
Alright. Oh and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
Umm... yes. Back home.
You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?
Good. I'm prepared to offer you a job. You can help out in the pharmacy until your California certification and references arrive but you are not to touch anyone. Is that totally clear?  Fine...
Yes ma'am.
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun has palm trees out front mountains in the background...
...I don't think I know that hospital.
Of course he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
Well I certainly would have heard about that.
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome gentle considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Of course I don't know every doctor who works here...
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
I gotta go.
Do what?
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick but I need to do this.
What are you talking about?
Betty honey listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
Sue Ann I thought you of all people would back me up on this you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
Sue Ann I'm sorry about all this but I just know there's something special out there for me...
Yeah hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep everything's gonna be fine.
Something bad happened to Del and me didn't it?
Well you are.
All the time...
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good even if it's only a little bit.
Oh I dunno... enough I s'pose.
Are you and Larry happy?
Let me know if you need anything okay?
I gotta go make dinner.
Sorry hon. Happy Birthday...
Yeah me too.
Oh I wish we could just get in it and drive and drive and drive!
He wasn't going to let us use it so I just took it.
What?
Maroon.  I stole it.
The LeSabre!
What?
Aahhh...  So what color is it?
Uh-huh. No we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday right? I'll have another one next year...
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
It's all right.
I can't ask her again -- Nathan stop it! Jesse don't take that hit back! -- I feel terrible hon.
No... what about your sister?
Honey I'm really sorry I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
Oh Betty --
Yep. Hey I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
Sure did. I'll tell you if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Did you watch it yet?
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
Thanks...
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
George...
Mmm-hmm. Listen I forgive you Mr. McCord...
I have... did it sound that bad?
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
Right... I was. I was an idiot plain and simple and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
Oh. Of course... sorry.
No I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
Why are you screaming at me? I mean what am I... why am I here? I don't...
But I'm David... I mean I'm not David but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy she is!
...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh are you George McCord?!
STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!
David please --
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
Well I don't know what you had in mind but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you my reputation and you're making me look like an idiot.
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
Why are you doing this to me?
Stop calling me David. We're on set for Christ's sake you don't have to call me David here.
David I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
In fact I want you to ad lib that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
Ad lib?
Your lines are in the script but you can ad lib.
Yes... maybe it was.
I remember. You said it to her but it was meant for me wasn't it?
You know I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie once at her funeral remember?...
Well I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
...but I love listening to you so that's okay...
It's easy to be dedicated when you care about something...
No I mean your dedication scares me...
I know that's why we were meant to be together...
I've never met anyone like you Betty.
No I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.  Was this before Leslie? Before us?...
Didn't I?
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
Well first I thought Patina and then the Ivy but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
She's a little jealous I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
I don't think your friend likes me.
I know. It's up to us.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined but... it's not up to me.
Of course.
I know. Listen we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients the hospital?
You should have a little faith in people.
Well what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
Rosa...
No please. Go ahead it's your funeral...
Are you sure I can borrow this?
But you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here you meet this guy who should laugh in your face and instead you leave with him!  Betty you are one-of-a-kind...
No almost never.
This isn't fair you know. Do you always get what you want?
I have lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
No I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So where'd you go?
Oh my gosh everything! My trip out here what we've both been doing you know...
Uh-huh... So what'd you talk about?
He is real.
Does he know you think he's real?
You still in love?
Oh God! You scared me! Yes...
Were you with him this whole time?
You never know who you'll see.
Looking for someone?
Umm...
Oh it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause but I don't have anybody to go with...
What are those for?
...okay.
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
This is crazy. I come home you go to your room. You go in the kitchen I go to my room. It's stupid.
Don't worry I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
Fine.
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
HE IS REAL!!
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Why'd you help me in the first place?
IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George by the way. His character!
If you didn't want to do it you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother but I was with you.
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit will you!
What? Where was he?!
Doctor David Ravell.
Who?
Guess who I saw today.
I was talking about what you could wear!
You said in L.A. anything goes.
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
How many men have I talked to?
Rosa I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
Fuck the details they're always to blame... Look too many of these guys duck out on us especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your you know fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
David isn't hiding from me I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
...so we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
Jesus I thought my love life was crazy...
No no! Well see she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
God that's awful!
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
He has a wife?!
I know what you mean I recently had some trouble with a man a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily I'm currently off men so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
You know the more I think about it this really isn't David's kind of place.
Ummm... no no. Different 'Ravell.'
You made it! Hey that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So how'd it go today? You find him?
Huh? Sure look in my closet take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight right?
Okay... oh umm would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
The Five?
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
Hey Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
Oh I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Yeah well at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
No this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there which I'm trusting you with 'cause if it gets out I'm on the street...
The one you were telling me about?
I got this apartment with a guy.
Listen when someone does the kind of thing you did you gotta do something in return. So you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
No that's not I couldn't...
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
Man that is love.
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
'David.' That's your guy. So you staying with him?
It's something I had to do. For David.
I came for love. My fiancé is here.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
You don't sound like you're from here.
LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS HE'S DEAD!
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
You're hurting him!!
He has no heartbeat!
What are you doing?
No you're not. You're a good doctor Lonnie but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now if you'll excuse me...
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school Blake.
Lonnie it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
We need someone with the right kind of experience Lonnie.
Blake I can handle that transplant!
Good.
No that should be more than --
More than you know. Is there anything else?
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
Deranged. That would be the right word.
How do you do Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours... a Ms. Betty...
What can I do for you gentlemen?
Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
Really. And where was that old man?
Did you know the most brutal inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
He goin' crazy on us or what?
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
The fuck you talking about?
Jeb Stuart Stonewall Jackson Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
Huh?
You know it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War but they still seem to get all the glory.
Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean so they're pretty hot.
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you it's cash only gentlemen.
What part of Dixie are you from Duane?
...and put them in your mouth.
Oh Jesus please... Please God.
My socks?
Well my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off please?
I... I don't know...
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa Kickapoo or Osage if I'm not mistaken.
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
Like what?
The Indians Injuns whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Wesley...
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
You need to remember who you're talking to...
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
No you believed her we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
I never said that I believed...
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory you believe that dumbshit trucker you believe this woman...
What doesn't?
Wait wait wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
No no Betty came here strictly for business 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So first thing we...
I dunno that lady sounded pretty sure...
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
Well... I think I saw her soul.
So you believed the bartender. Why?
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees doesn't she?!...
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.
What?
I'm not telling.
Where? Where is she?
Well guess what? I found Betty... where she's been anyway.
Yes I am and we're not going. Act professional.
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
I said 'No.' N-O.
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City or Houston or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
No.
It's a very moving experience trust me.
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
We should go.
Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde thin' yes... Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything?
You know blonde thin whatever...
How'd they describe her?
I don't know but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
That was a really shitty thing to do.
What the hell's the matter with you?
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention do you? Nah. You're like me.
Well I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red!
Worse... you're in Texas.
Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!
AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
I know that.
That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
It's not an exact science Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
Thas' it thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
Well then did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
Wise beyond her years I'm sure and such poise too.  Very very impressive...
No... like a worthy adversary Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
Like... us?
Oh for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Betty Betty Betty...
You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for what three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
No I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
Yeah well if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur just like Del was.
I'd say that about torches her credibility wouldn't you?
...among others.
Joyce was screwing Del.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here and get the fuck gone.
I hope you're right...
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift remember?
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
Well no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
What the hell was that another statement?
Wait. Any last words General Lee?
Should I kill him now?
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
Actually I scalped him and then you killed him.
Del's dead by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
I'm a Yankee myself. Massachusetts.
We can live with that.
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
Mmmm. Well it was a piece of luck running into you Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
Fine I'll get you a bumpersticker but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.
...that's a good motto.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy just good. They get in they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom boom boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
I wanted to make a statement.
Why not it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something now that you fucked it up.
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
It's not here. Let's go.
What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
Well why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
I wasn't done I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out you scalped him. Christ I almost puked did I tell you that?
That one look you got! I thought you were done so I took him out...
What 'look'?
I didn't. You gave me a look!
I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts.
I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do.
Well why'd you shoot him?
We don't know which Buick do we?
He told us it's in the Buick.
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
That was to get him to talk!  Get rid of that thing will you?
You told me how to do it!
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
IT SURE IS!!
I'm all for them owning casinos getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony isn't it Wesley?
A mark huh?
Hold still Del we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
It wasn't always fatal Wesley. We could scalp Del right now and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
Hell of a way to die.
You know a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
So you see we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
Now that's really stupid.
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
That is so right.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are by their very nature untrustworthy.
That's right.
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
No that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
Relax we brought the cash.
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
Beer please.
Bourbon little water thank you.
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now without a doubt that your granddaughter is alive and did not kill Del Sizemore.
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed it would have been me.
What do you mean?
I don't like talking bad about the dead but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes she of all people was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
Betty was a lovely child.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
This is Betty at twelve.
...who doesn't?
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
If it helps bring her back be my guest...
I see.  May I?
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all but that's the way I feel about all of this...
But she wanted more out of life right?
Aren't you a sweetheart... no not quite. Anyway she's been with us awhile.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
Oh five years give or take.
...and how long did she work here?
Okay uh... the umm Injuns're stupid.
He's waiting...
Jesus Christ!
You better believe it.
Really?
It is if you like idiots...
Seems like a nice place.
Yeah well I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
Isn't that the point?
Huh? Oh umm a car.  So to a successful transaction...
What'd you get her?
Then do as you're told. Get her back.
Jesus don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me I'll never land a pilot.
That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
This story is beyond belief which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
I SAID FORGET IT!
Let me try this goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
No! Let me try this!
All right everybody! That's ten minutes!
No! No problem there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days now do it!
Is there a problem George?
If you need a minute that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --
What the hell's going on?
Betty I thought this would be the best way. You know throw you into it...
...yeah.
Hmm?
Actually she was my discovery... just like you.
Fine but promise me one thing. If we use her I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
I said I'll think about it.
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
I'll think about it.
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
I don't know George...
Oh of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
No George we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year remember?
Can I have an evil twin?
We know that...
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring Lyla.
I know George I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
Yeah bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
Right uhh... I feel terrible about this we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
Funny that's just what I was thinking...
No wait... what happened next Betty?
Alright I admit it you had me there. You're better than most of them anyway... do you have a headshot?
Sure.
Hey can you sneak me on the lot?
Oh fuck...
Better.
Damn that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Uh-huh.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Ahh Mercedes I think. Black.
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
Because it ain't natural young man.
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
Oh there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood... caring for her father going to school.
Would you say she was ambitious?
And she always had such spirit! But after her mother died...
Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!...
Yeah. Why you know him?
No about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
What did you say?
Names a phone number something...  Listen Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
I don't know what you think you'll find anyway.
Blah -- blah -- blah... Hurry up will ya I got a date tonight...
Ahh I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
No... before that.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead Betty's gone. She's probably dead too.
Look Joyce I need your key to the files not advice okay? This is a complex case.
You're wastin' your time Roy.
Oh yeah... Man I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
God that sounds so familiar. Ravell Ravell... where's he out of?
David Ravell.
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
I swear to God!
You lie motherfucker...
She's a lesbian.
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
Did Chloe crack?
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up both of you before I kill you!
It's Sue Ann Rogers Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
Oh umm yes this is Dwight Campbell.
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
Huh?
Mr. Campbell?
Yeah?
Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape by any chance?
I don't think she will. She's a slut but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
Her show?
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
No.  Well her grandparents are down in Oklahoma but that's it...
Aren't they precious?  Ma'am she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
I wish I could help you but I can't.
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
