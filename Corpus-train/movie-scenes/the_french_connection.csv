Tumble it.  One end to the other.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Walter I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.
Yeah we got the Westbury covered like a tent.
Bill keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week.
Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
Why don't you do the same Doyle? You look like shit.
Who's on him?
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
Third time around.
Same car.
Four.
Timezit?
This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
We put him to bed for the night.
What about Sal?
The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up.
The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.
Pour it in your ear.
You want the red or the white?
Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.
Throw 'em in the bathroom will you? How good are the warrants?
We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.
You got the warrant?
The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
What happened to you?
Let yourself in.
Why not?
I can't.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
Yeah.
Popeye.
This could be it Walter.  This Candy Store guy putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own after working the whole day and night we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
We're goin' now!  Goodbye.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx if you're bullshitting me it's your ass.
I'm wounded.  Oh oh.
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
Makin' wine in the basement.  He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.
Suspicion of what?
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
Toy wit' this will ya.
Make it Alexander's I like the toy department.
If that's not a drop or a pickup I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
A and A that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
Monica?  Who's Monica?
Come on -- just for fun --
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
The greaser with the blonde.
Give who a tail?
Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
He probably sells insurance.  Owns a chicken farm in Hackensack.
Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
No you?
What about the last of the big-time spenders.  You make him?
Policy man in Queens.
Who is that guy?
Hey I thought we come for a drink.
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo I know him too.
Whip it out.
Drink this.
Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you say?
Some other time Jimmy I'm beat.
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
Not a chance.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
He coulda been white.
Never trust a nigger.
How'd I know he had a knife.
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Who stuck up the laundromat?

Where'd you get this fag shit?
Whatta you got?
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
Hiya Jesus.
Hey Bo.
For dead bodies.
For garbage?
It was a crematorium.
What was it?
Oh it's been abandoned for years.
What is that old building?
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant a hospital a training school for garbage men and that area over there where the old cars are kept prior to being processed for shipment to among other places The Charnier Shipping Company of Marseilles France.
The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast.  Years ago hundreds of ships went down here.
Why is it called Hellgate?
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
Darling may I have this one?
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is as you know your prime source of scrap metal M. Charnier.
Just for mistakes of parking?
There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.
He could go someplace else with his sixty kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million cash.  He wouldn't find there was any hurry to do this kind of business.
I'm straight Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look I'm tellin' you he'll take the deal somewhere else.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
I been damn careful up to now.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned move calmly move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
Joel don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
What am I a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.
