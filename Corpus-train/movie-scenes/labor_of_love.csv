Here comes the resume.
Why am I such an authority?
This smells good.
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
What is it?
For a walk.  I don't know.
Where?
He probably just went somewhere.
I won't let you die.
I have to finish first.
I'm completing the walk.  I'm almost there.
Listen to me very carefully because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California it was a miracle now let's try to save your life.
I finish the walk and then we may take all the chances we want.
What?
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
How serious is it?
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
You should definitely have children.  They're really special.
Maybe later.
Are you two planning kids?
Uncle the way I was told if that police car didn't happen down that road you would be dead right now. That guy Denny had jumped bail in another state he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys if you don't plan.
Nothing's going to happen.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
Why did you take the back roads here?  They're not safe.  You'd know that if you'd planned.
No it's not.
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
I'll make it.
What if you don't make it?
You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
It's impossible.
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside just listen to me.  Come back with me now and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
I don't accept that.
I have new dreams now.
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
Uncle Maurice you're wearing sneakers?
Don't wait by the phone.  If he's really been walking this whole time he's out of our jurisdiction...
Thank you.
Look I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information I'll call you.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
How long does this... Mania last?
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident and will act out impractical grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
Sergeant I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
What would you like us to do?
I'll kill you!
Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
That's enough.
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
You need a ride Preacher?
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
No I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.
Are you a preacher?
Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
Mine.
It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
What steps do we take now?
It can but it'll have to wait in line.
Can it kill me?
