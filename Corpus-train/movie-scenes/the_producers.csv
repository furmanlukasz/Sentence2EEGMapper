He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 
Don't help me.
Ahhhhhh.  Leo Leo Leo.
Well I... Well it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat fat fat.
What is it?
Max I...
What are you doing?  We're trapped. It's either the show or us.  There's no way out.  What can we do blow up the theatre?
Liebkind no!
They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind go!  Kill!
Shut up.
What???
Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!
Double.  Double.  Double.
Ohhhhhhhhh how I hate you.
I never should have listened to you.
I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long.
What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?
The majority.  The majority.  Yes. Let's hear from the majority.
Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
Bloom Bloom maybe it's not true.
No way out.  No way out.
Maybe it's not true!
To failure!
To failure!
Watch closely as Bialystock drives the last nail into the coffin.
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it Roger that dress is you.
Well it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
Only if we ask him.
Do you think he'll take the job?
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
Stop talking like that you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it baby flaunt it!
Max as I was saying maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
I'll show you.  Ulla go to work.
What is she gonna do here?
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
What are you doing?
OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
Leo what if this play is a hit?
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Okay take it off take it off.
Look I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
How's this? 
It's a little better but you still look angry.
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
Will you get a hold on yourself.
Aaaaaaaaaa!
I'm not going to jump on you!
Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down up and down until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
What???
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
You're going to jump on me.
You miserable cowardly wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
Oh I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
Mr. Bialystock not more than five minutes ago against my better judgment I doctored your books. That sir is the ultimate extent of my criminal life.
No Bloom you don't understand. This is fate this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.
Bloom worlds are turned on such thoughts!
Oh no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
What scheme?  Your scheme you bloody little genius.
What scheme?
Aha aha aha aha aha aha!!  So in order for the scheme to work we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
Oh you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit you'd have to pay off the backers and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around get it?
But what if the play was a hit?
See?  You could have raised a million dollars put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
One night.
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
But the play only cost $60000 to produce.
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see if you were really a bold criminal you could have raised a million.
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
What did I do?
You've done it yourself only you did it on a very small scale.
What do you mean?
Well it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
Assume away!
You keep saying that but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
Yes it's quite possible.
You were saying that under the right circumstances a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
What was I saying?
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
Yes what?
Now let's see if we add these figures we get ...
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
Now let's see two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
Oh it's all right ... wha?
Thank you Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
Help!
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
But that's cheating!
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars  Bloom do me a favor move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out you could go to prison.
I went to a Turkish bath who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
According to the backer's list you raised $60000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
Where?  What?
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
Yes Prince Mishkin what can we do for you?
Mr. Bialystock ...
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
Here don't panic.
It's nothing ... nothing.
What is that?  A handkerchief?
Twenty-eight seconds hurry hurry you're using up your time.
In looking at your books I've discovered that ...
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
Well sir it seems ...
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
Sir may I speak to you for a minute?
Good what is it?
I have hurt your feelings.
I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption you fish-faced enemy of the people?
Koff koff ... ahem ahem ... harrumph ...
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby when you got it flaunt it.
Window's so filthy can't tell if it's day or night out there.
Yes sir.  Thank you.
Do the books!  Do the books!
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
But sir I'm not condem ...
Then account for yourself!  Do you believe in God?  Do you believe in gold?  Why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert eh?
Yes sir.
I'm Leo Bloom I'm an accountant I'm from Whitehall and Marks I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady. 
All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
Scared.  Can't talk.
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak dummy speak!  Why don't you speak?
Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
Ooooooops.
Oooooooops!
I'll wait in the hall ...
You mean ooops don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
Enough.  It's better.  Please Lambchop it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
Do you need us?
I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle it's a monster... but it's still my child.
Do it!  Do it!
All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
Yes.  Amazing isn't it?
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance more density. Therefore it burns slower.
Qviet.  Qviet  This is very important.
Come on.  Let's get going.
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
You mean out of business.  Heh heh.
Now ve take the two fuse leads attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
It's that LSD und his verdampter babies!...
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
Always.
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind have I ever steered you wrong?
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
Cowards miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
Not.
All right but remember if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation I kill you.
Franz trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
I don't know.  I don't know.
Don't look at the outside look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler who danced his way to glory.
But he has long hair!
Franz don't you see Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
Vaaaat???
It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
Good.  I will make the preparations.
Yes.  We would!
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
We swear it!
Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler the Hitler you knew the Hitler you loved the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill did they?  Oh no Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this and you're getting it straight from the horse Hitler vas better looking than Churchill he vas a better dresser than Churchill had more hair told funnier jokes and could dance the pants off Churchill!
Really I never dreamed ...
Oh sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen singing und dancing.  You know not many people knew about it but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
No kidding?
Vit the Fuhrer of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
With whom?
I vas vit him a great deal you know.
You're not as you Americans say dragging my leg are you?
We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.
Vat about it?
Yes.
Mr. Liebkind relax relax we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
Mr. Liebkind wait ...
Mr. Liebkind wait.  You don't understand.
I vas never a member of the Nazi party.  I am not responsible.  I only followed orders.  Who are you?
No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.
We make love?
