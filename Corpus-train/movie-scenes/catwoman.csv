Adonis be polite. She's a friend.
Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
I'm not going to worry about it. We are quite beyond the computer disc. Everything will be over within the next hour or so.
I don't know about you guys but I'm getting a little buzz off this.
Works for me.
Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody give it a swat...
Have we reached the epi-center?
It's okay. Let her go.
Oh Man not the sewer I just had this cape cleaned...
You have to dial nine first.
I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
Do I have to remind everyone that in two days we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission...
Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
The crowd bought it.
Sorry sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God Captain God I shall not fail you..
Hey Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...
Yeah all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..
You know nobody likes you...
That's a good one dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.
""
Be verwy verwy quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
Ah Cats. Now and Forever.
This looks promising...
I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...
Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...
Cactus I can't believe you just said all that...
I lied.
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
We'll hunt him down together...
In many ways that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
You're serious?  You'd help me...
It would be honor Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
Somewhere very far away very quiet and very...  This is all wonderful Selina but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
Oh now you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you Jeff.
Quite a pair we make. Thank you Jeff.
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
No-o. You know questions like that don't help your cause--
You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..
Hmm. Not bad.
What did you say?  Selina sit down the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
Tonight somewhere in the city innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
Uh Brock today you are without me...
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
I'm sure.
Are you sure?
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
Well it's just that I would think that the woman who is the real non- imitation Catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea. Really angry.
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!
No it's not.
What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's it's...Catwoman.
I'm sorry I went off like that I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten.  When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
I despise these kind of winds. Sorry I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone men and women on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
You're very special. Selina I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I again?
Hey hey the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
Oh it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
What did you think?
You designed Gotham Plaza?  The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
I'm not afraid. Are you?
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion if..
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way I'm Brock Leviathan.
How heroic of you...
I was wondering if you're not doing anything tonight...Would you like to go to dinner? I know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the Oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless would you?
You're probably right.
Nothing just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
What's the matter...
I wonder..
Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
I don't know. I can't remember.
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
Guilty. I am.
You say that like an amnesia victim.
I'll bet. Funny for some reason I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
No in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
In women?
He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes...
What little boy doesn't?
I guess we did. When you were a little boy did you want to be a superhero?
But then we knew that all along didn't we...
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
I've been looking for you.
It may be time to get the police involved...
I can. That's not an admission of guilt  It's just..I knew you had it in you...
Did you ever think that maybe neither of us is Captain God?
Quiet Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning Selina I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God or whatever else he may be calling himself this month but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
We're waiting.
Your uniform that first time I saw you was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..
You're right I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
You're kidding.
Yes did you call us here for any particular reason?
Selina are you okay?
Oh you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
I better go report this in...
I suppose she does.
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
A bit on the suspicious side don't you think?
She has a real spirit.
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
Women huh?
Can I just say what a classy touch the neon urinals are Mr. Architect?  I just love risking electrocution every time I..
Oh how long have you had your own route?
There you are darling...Have we met Lewis Lane Oasisburg Times.
Oh come on Cactus be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule right?
Catwomen. Lots of them!
Wha-at?
God can you hear me!
Just hold on!  I'm not done. There are two kinds of men in the world Selina. In Category A you have Me. In Category B is everyone who wants to be in Category A but are too afraid too weak..!
Boss we better roll if we're going to hit this place blow it up and make that flight..
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes twice for..
Priceless...We have a showdown in this alley right?
Hey speaking of Wrong Place Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
Even the skylight?
Don't you realize there's nothing you can do anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked locked and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
Well then let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?
You might be right but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
I know I know a Warrior. You're very annoying..Now tell me how to defuse the bomb you've set..
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect I'm a..
Pass!
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day and by night we'll dress up and kill anything that...
Oh Honey it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
My dog!
At this point a nap. Oh by the way I killed your butler and your dog..
What do you want from me?
Winning.
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
Touchy. Look everybody it's Casper the friendly crimefighter...
Cactus sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
Yeah this is better than rape.
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
Not now Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big violent complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
Ooh I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
What's the catch?
He didn't remember to roll up his window...
I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine whine whine. Will he settle?
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
Absolutely.
Car wash Captain?
I got her...
Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down let's chat..
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry we've got work to do.
Ah did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
I know how you feel humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...
Sorry man I didn't mean that personally...
What did you say?
God-damn..
How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
I don't know Boss you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
Why am I still troubled...
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
Well. I stand corrected.
That is not a man Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
I know.
I loved you.
Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman as long as I'm a good warrior.
Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.
I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.
What's the matter with you Spooky my most trusted comrade?  We are warriors!  These are the challenges we live for!
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
Oh I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos we'll regroup in the morning.
You like them don't you Boss.
Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.
Well you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
A bit sadistic don't you think Captain...?
Well we spent enough time building the damn thing might as well use it.
Now he'll be up all night...
Oh I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
You can't get away with..
Ah the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
You've seen me...
You think so?...Selina?
I still have one left...
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
Oh please sir one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
My those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible corrupt joke.
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
And...your point?
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary sick fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
Hello Rachel. I'm Selina.
You know my name's not Spooky. It's it's Rachel.
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
And I...I..want you to know our secrets..
For when the..Uh yeah thanks a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
For when the time comes..
Men huh?
I heard what you said Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...
You're not strong. You're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you. Whatever the Cult of Good was it's not anymore... You don't have to listen to me just listen to you..
Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape boots chestplate and a mechanical spear can bring..
Whatever you say...Sis.
I don't want to hurt you Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow you can do anything you want but please just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
Hello Spooky.
Spear.
Spooky.
Ask me another one--
What's the name of your child's best friend?
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
I'm a good mother!
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
Kelly get to work on those new uniforms.  I'm not running a summer camp here..
Oh Frank I'm not anti-male I'm anti- you. Believe me there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees look into it.
Hey you're anti-male.
Can I be frank Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
Stop.
You know Kyle you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
What's the good news?
You're late. I've got some good news and some good news. I'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in.
I'll let you know.
We have to do something. What can we do to help Selina?
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life.
You know now that I hear myself tell it I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday then Brock takes it for the weekend...
Then there's you Louis sneaking through back alleys and surprise visiting me at my home..Both of you have been way too frisky from the get- go. I'm actually a pretty amazing person--funny smart attractive when I get my sleep--but you two had no way of knowing that-- when I met you both I was basically a morose depressed amnesiac incapable of any human feeling. The only reason one of you wanted to go out with me is because you knew I was Catwoman.
Not too cool...
Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.
Hey architect--she's joking. Right Selina?  Selina?
Uh-huh..
You are...
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
You're scaring me Selina.  Do it some more.
Hey I thought...
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
Like you don't know...
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay I can't stand it anymore I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
Nothing. How's your hand?
What?
Did you try to kill...
Actually yes.
Oh do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
You turned around!
What did--?
Hey Captain God!
I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat do you?
Next time call...
Well. I'd let you come in but the place is a mess...
No of course not. You're listed. Not the hut exactly but the rest of..
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
Good morning.
Ah!  Ah!--God no don't tell me you're one of those women who are attracted to ruggedly handsome and brilliant architects..
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
I was wondering if you're not doing anything tonight...
But of course you are.
Oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..You know I realize I've never officially introduced myself...I'm Lewis Lane.
Oh now this one is mine...
Enough.
How much?
I actually got some memory back last night.
Sorry I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all if it was a man dressed as a cat the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh I want this one. I want her bad..
Yeah she's okay.
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just I like her a lot.
I don't know what came over me.
Okay deal.
What if I say I'll go out with you so you can have all these great daydreams but then never actually talk to you again?
It's seeing-eye dogs ma'am. If I let the cat stay will you go out with me?
But I'm blind.
I'm sorry ma'am there are no pets allowed in the library...
Trust me you won't have to.
I don't know if I can do it alone.
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
Yes you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
Mom not now!  I I don't know what to do..
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
Yes I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
Mom?  Oh Mom I messed up...
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
Uh it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
Don't sneak up on me...
Oh so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
I'll take your abuse but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
Pretty good...Mom I don't want you to think I don't appreciate...letting me stay getting me the job--I've been a mess. I'm still a mess. It's just...we have to start having a different conversation. I can't take..
Maybe.
Oh Mommy you're embarrassing me.
Oh I forgot to tell you you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
Yes Mother. Dear.
You're late.
Thanks.
Nice breasts.
You going to talk all day?
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
The kicks..the rush..you mean like pulling heists..faking your own deaths..killing innocent bystanders...like Mexican angels.  I know you're a woman. Do you?
I'm not sad no I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while you don't care what's a crime and what's not what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
You seem sad Spooky.
We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...
What's it like being a superhero?  It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
Oh pooh come now. If you turn me down I just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be..
I'm sorry Miss one of us needs to keep surveillance...
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
