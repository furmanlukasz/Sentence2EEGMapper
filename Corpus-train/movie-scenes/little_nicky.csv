Absolutely not.
Now will you get in the flask?
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
Is this a joke?
Adrian I'm asking you nicely in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
Little Nicky.
Hey that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
I hear a train coming. Drink.
Let her go.
Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you she won't come back from where she's going.
How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Yeah he needs souls to live. When you guys left you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
He's sick?
Adrian you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
Please get out of my mind!
You shouldn't have come here.
ADRIAN!
Don't do it!
No!
I was going to let you out eventually Cassius. I swear.
Thank you Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
You mother...
You know New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
All right. Let me out.
Hello Cassius.
Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
Well we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
It's our time brother.
...their damned souls will be ours.
Eventually Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
We could create our own hell there.
What do you think about... Earth?
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
That's what I thought!
Yeah get out of here! Beat it!
Um excuse me we're having a private conversation here.
It's just such a slap in the face.
And he's dead serious.
You work your ass off for ten thousand years hurting people helping others hurt people then you get a decision like that.
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
You want a queen? Got one right here.
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
I'm calling you out brother...
Urr... uggg... errr...
Oh Nicky I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
Uh. No it won't?
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
And give you a good buzz.
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in uh... er science magazine.
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
Sure why not?
But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
Noon...
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
She goes to Parson's right?
Show him Central Park.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
You know we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
I'll call her later.
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
I remember that night you had like four daiquiris.
So excited.
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you I am so excited right now.
You're already there...
Well Mommy get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
It would be so okay.
Well nice meeting you Jenna Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes you'll know what to do.
What is it?
A speech impediment?
Stronger yes. Smarter definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Yeah you do...
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
She's so nice.
Valerie's crying!
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
How did you see me?
It was a long time ago at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
Where did you meet my father?
Angels don't get any older son.
How come you're not older?
Well she was about six-three only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
Wow. What... what did she look like?
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
An angel?
Try an angel.
My mom wasn't a goat?
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
Okay can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
Maybe try the opposite of that.
The home of eternal damnation house of Hades H.E. double toothpicks...
That turn you on there RuPaul?
Oh my God he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
I can't screw.  I can't screw.
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows he can't piss smoke.
He'll be here. Just keep your cool kid.
Where is he? He's late.
No.
Did you just talk?
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
What's Nicky doing down there?
This is baloney!
I think you're looking at him.
I was with Valerie I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
I didn't murder anybody
The shit has hit the fan kid. Take a look.
I seem to be in trouble Beefy.
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
I'm just saying there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
Release the evil?
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil bat's blood moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
What can I do about it?
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
Well let's rock and roll.
Come on there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
Okay just point me in the right direction next time.
Look it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
Put it in your mouth.
So far so good. Now what?
That pain is hunger.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
You're on Earth now kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
It's freezing up here Beefy.
Makin' friends already.
Oh. Sorry.
It's not me moron.
The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
I mean... tough break.
Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
This was a very difficult decision because I have three wonderful sons. I mean Adrian so smart so ruthless. And Cassius so strong so tough. And Nicky so... so...
Okay kid we'll listen to it later.
Hey Dad I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
Now everybody sit down.
Cassius didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
Nothing Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
Beast.
Bus?
You got it.
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Thanks.
That's a pretty brassiere.
Hey.
That's what I'm thinkin'...
Coulda been much worse.
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs right?
I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies I catch everything...
That's nice Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
Boogerland!
What was it called sir.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
It's Stanley sir.
You know what was in Hell when I came down here Cassius?
I started slow though. For years I was just giving people hot foots. Actually you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one too. One day she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I'll take the soup.
I know your wickedness.
You know I was the one who created Hell.
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
You're not saying it's up to me?
I'm just a demon Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
So go get 'em Jimmy!
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
Okay but Jimmy when the house is rockin' don't forget the knockin'!
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
Hey...
Of course you do Tommy Tune.
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
Oh would you grow up.
Easy Liberace.
No.
By she do you mean he?
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
This don't look good.
Peppermint... alright.
Schnapps...
We know where to find Nicky.
Looking for the chief.
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
You sure you're down with this?
We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands right now. Wanna come Nicky?
That's a big pass Elton John.
Six six six pick up sticks.
Look who's back from the dead.
The Dark Prince is here.
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
Yeah. You do it.
Should we wake him up?
Yo man I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
What's with that guy?
Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
There's our man.
'Bout time...
Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
See ya fellas.
Whoa that chick must be the real deal then. Later on.
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
Not again fellas. It kind of hurts.
Come on. One more time.
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
That way.
Which way did he go?
I was DeNiro!
Yes great movie...
Recently yes! So I run up behind this guy and start bashing his brains in with this bat and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
You keep a bat under your seat?
I followed him all the way downtown and when he gets out of the car I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
You followed him?
So I followed him...
Oh that's terrible Reege...
So I was driving to work today and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
I'll just go to Heaven.
You gotta kill yourself.
Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
Dude. Seriously?
Good idea... kill me.
Dude it's us. Let us in.
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
All right...
Please. You got to.
Oh. Sorry Andrew. Valerie?
You got the wrong window again man.
Andrew.
Adrian?
I don't need luck. I'm good.
Thanks much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
Valerie Doran? Two floors up one window over.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
You smell like coconuts.
Hello.
I love you.
I love you.
Do me.
From my dad's side of the family.
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
That was Cassius!
Nicky!
I have to Valerie.
Don't do it.
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
East Rutherford.
We're going to Jersey?
Next time. Tonight I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
Can we go fly over Central Park?
Okay I do. Get back up here.
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
Well that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me but not with my brothers so they broke out of Hell causing my dad...
Yes...
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
Look just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
Why would you be floating?
I think I'm floating.
What are you doing?
No.
Are you dead?
Valerie?
I'm not sure but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
What were you thinking coming here?
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
Hey.
I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...
What was that?
Your juicy heart-shaped ass.
What?
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you Valerie?
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
Basically yeah.
So you're saying make all pants with a drawstring then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
Good. I was concerned.
Sometimes sure.
Valerie it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
My perfume?
What's that pleasant smell coming from your skin?
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
School?
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
I'm not sure. I'd ask him but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
You have a dog? What kind?
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows though.
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
It's not that cold. Here let me wrap it.
It's freezing my hands.
Uh it's a deep south expression.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
If you want to.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Here have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
Well I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
If I don't save him I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
My dad's in hell and he's falling apart.
My dad's an optometrist.
I don't know but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
Why are you laughing?
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him not sure why.
Really?
The South.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
You think I'm a tourist?
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
That just hurt a lot.
Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl Valerie.
If it's Cassius yes.
A black guy?
It looks like the work of a brother...
And sorry man but no dogs allowed.
I don't know.
Why is that funny?
Yeah. The deep South.
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
No.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
Off limits.
Eight-hundred split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
Yes. What is rent?
Uh don't you want to know what the rent is?
Hello friend my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
Sir I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
Okay now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
I don't know?
