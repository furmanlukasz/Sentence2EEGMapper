Been here all my life.
You mean she taught in a prison?
Are you recycling?
That and then I wasn't able to.
I don't know that anybody would feel good.
Say the rice dish.
Which is the strangest thing I had ever heard.

He's run into so many problems.
It's was a night out.
I know where my son works.
Our gardening we lost.
Seeing New England.

Nobody could figure it out.
Or a row of seats actually.
You understand what I am saying.
To take care of a problem before it grows big.
There was no word on casualties.
The reality is it's usually not the case.
I'm not sure.
It's actually turning out to be more.
Be our first chance in awhile.
It's too bad it happened.
I have the right to voice my opinion.
Still have to spray some.
My mother was complaining last year about that.
When I come back to my seat.
That Texas twang or whatever you want to call it.
Nothing wrong with those.

It just depends on what kind they are.
At the craft shop.
How long did that movie run?
Or maybe twenty dolls.
My husband does the same thing.
I haven't had to replace the thing yet.
Not all the time.
That's awful.
You're not old.
I've never been up there.
Some good books that I've read.
There's some different things.
Those are running.

Is it like a foreign exchange type student?
Elected not to do so.
They were great men.
Replace some of the belts.
The great audience.
Plastic and paper.
It took me back to the sixties.
Little things like that.
What I have to do.
You either pay the thing off or they come get it.
Without any warning whatsoever.
Substantial amounts of money.
That's the way they suck you in.
The kids in that class.
I'm a practicing vegetarian.
With the jury actually making the verdict.
My husband is a movie fanatic.
There's still a big question in my mind.

I'm not saying that they were.
It's something that interests me.
You have to have the picturesque kitchen.
He's someone different.
There's nothing to do.

These kids work really hard.
They had a centennial here awhile back.
Despite all of our open space out here.
Certainly if you wash it any amount of time.
The teacher's in the middle.
Commercial television these days.
I could use a card too.
I don't know if they decided to do.
What do you find that you use yours mostly for?
This particular card.
I was glad to get rid of leaded gasoline.
Want to spend the money for it?
This was a long time ago.
They will kill you.
Essentially anything you find in a house.
There's another aspect of this.
They hold it up to the sun God.
Just because it only takes a few minutes to cook.
Three weeks after.
It's about two hundred people.
Television is my main news source.

At an entirely different bank.
This woman just offered it to me.
I like it here.
He was a courier.
It's hard for me to.

Have a family.
Looks like we're it now.
Do you go by the ads when you look at them?
He's heading off.
Now can she leave?
Haven't been to one for a little while.
I do other things very well.
He had been in that position for years.
Did he go into that in the book?
The recession.
I don't know about your part of the country.
I had someone tell me that.
Do you know where you're going?
It was on his way of going downhill.
You set your brake.
Did you have to do that?
We do it all I really think that.
Our immigration history.
I think in some cases.
They are both remarried.
The high school I went to.
You have to think grandchildren.
You could do it.

They plastered over drywall.
I'll slice white grape.
The bomb development.
On the outskirts of Houston.
I forget how she got it.
