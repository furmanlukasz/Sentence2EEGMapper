It won't fly!
How did you know Tom was planning on doing that?
Give me thirty minutes.
The work calls for great patience.
Tom bought some potatoes from a local farmer.

You'll never beat me again.
You just screwed up.
I didn't do that, because I was sick.

That does happen occasionally.
The West no longer runs the show.
He surprised her with a fancy dinner.
Sami was preparing a salad.
Peel and core eight apples. Put into each apple two cloves and as much mincemeat as it will hold.
I think Tom will come to Boston on Monday.
I did warn Tom.
I'm pleased to have you here.
The future depends on us and our generation.
How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in the back of your head.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary really knows how to do that very well.
She has already left.
Promise me.
Give Tom back what belongs to him.
Tom was willing to help you.
Does Tom also speak French?
I think that Tom is having fun.
There are times when I miss her.
Yanni got the job.
I'll do that while it's quiet.
They don't belong to any official intelligence agency.
If I had had to do it, I would have done it at that time.

Where did you stay for so long?
Tom has been in the bathroom for quite a while.
Ivan uploaded the pics on social media.
I like participating in this project.

She wanted to work for him.
He served them champagne.
They told me they'd call tomorrow.
I'm going to talk to Tom when he comes home.
Tom and Mary knew that they couldn't get to the airport by 2:30.
He's standing on the edge of the chasm.
Why don't you let Tom know you have to do that?
Who dares?
It was a high production dog dream. They even had catering.
Why are you calling the front desk? "I want an early wake up call."
Ziri has got to go straight to school.
I swear I'll never do that again.
Sami and Layla want to go to the mall.
Tom is a better French speaker than Mary.
Sami and Layla were having the time of their life.
It was a waste of taxpayers' money.
You are at school.
I helped Tom escape from prison.
Tom is likely to come by taxi.
Tom ruffled his daughter's hair.
Not every nice-looking thing is useful.
You should feel bad for her.
This is the job Tom pays us for.

She is well-liked by everyone.
I immediately knew I was in trouble.
The sooner you start doing that, the sooner you'll be finished.
Ziri realized he was caught.

In general the physical and mental form of conscious beings is an expression of the character of the planet on which they live. On certain very large and aqueous planets, for instance, we found that civilization had been achieved by marine organisms. On these huge globes no land-dwellers as large as a man could possibly thrive, for gravitation would have nailed them to the ground. But in the water there was no such limitation to bulk. One peculiarity of these big worlds was that, owing to the crushing action of gravitation, there were seldom any great elevations and depressions in their surface. Thus they were usually covered by a shallow ocean, broken here and there by archipelagos of small, low islands.
Ziri heard a slap on his car window.
Yanni just said that like four minutes ago.
They did that entirely on their own.
I didn't study yesterday.
Would you be so kind as to translate this for me?

Tom has been horrible to Mary.
Let's take it one step at a time.
He would swear at the naughty boys in the neighborhood.
Basketball is a lot of fun.
I didn't know why Tom had to do that.
Someone other than Tom did that.
We cannot sleep well on summer nights.
Time passes quickly when we're doing something we enjoy.
I hope you understand.
No act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans.
Yanni's life depends on that.

She thinks she's being reasonable.
I wasn't there that night.
Mennad made pancakes this morning.
I don't know how that could happen.
He received a million-dollar settlement.
Tom also plans to do that.
When I was a kid, I used to spend hours listening to the radio.
I think that Tom has lied to us.
Yanni almost ran into an incoming car.
He drowned in the ocean.
Tom and Mary are going to be disappointed if you don't go to their party.
In those days a village of thirty houses or more stood there; now no one liveth there, and only sometimes do the people come here to gather cocoanuts.
Mary spends most of her time at the library.
I'd rather have this and not need it than need it and not have it.
Yanni could have lost his life that night.

That film was very moving.
Tom often does that in the afternoon.
We just need a little time.

I knew I'd be able to do that by 2:30.
No one knew what to do.
Ziri never replied to that message.
England go out on penalties again.
He died in jail.
They looked like they were attentive.
He is a head taller than me.
He was delighted.
I don't think that Tom has enough time to write the report today.
No one's obliged to do more than they're able.
He's a sex maniac.
Do you know what they said?
Tom begged his parents to let him go to Boston.
Since it was raining, Nancy hesitated to go out.
They burned the captured supplies.
This material is ruined.
Her house is surrounded by a white fence.

I'm happy because beginning today, we have no school until September.
Keep your son from having his own way.
He agreed to your terms.
At the moment, money is my only hope.

Tom is used to the heat, isn't he?
Who is that stranger?
She turns her back on me.
Tom finally caught up to Mary.
She is not only gentle but brave.
Ah, the trailing group has arrived. "Oh no. They caught up with us while we were resting."

Do you think you'd be happy doing that?
Tom was afraid of us.
This fall was long and not too cold.

It's boring at home.
Tom refused to tell me what to do.
Tom must be mistaken.
Tom went over to Mary's to help her move some furniture.
Tell Tom we're busy.
The elderly woman in front of me in the checkout line took forever to pay for her groceries.
Here were some relics.
Mary told me that she thought I might be interested in doing that.
I wish that we'd left early, too.
I think we should ask Mary where she wants to live.
Tom said Mary didn't look happy to see me.
You talk so fast I can't understand a word you say.
Sami wanted to take a vacation with us.
I saw Michaela and Caroline in town this afternoon.
I'm using the computer.
He disagreed.
I'm sure Tom will be skeptical.
We flew the Atlantic in a few hours.
Ziri wants to grow the ivy into a bonsai tree.
What do you think about them?
Have you been vaccinated?
I feel we speak a different language.
That was all Tom knew about Mary.
It was just a joke.
Tom told Mary he'd visit her in Boston every weekend.
People who do bodybuilding are called bodybuilders.
It's an excuse.
Sami didn't want to piss Layla off.
Maybe Mary doesn't know she's not supposed to help Tom do that.
His annoyance is understandable.
I didn't think Tom would let me borrow his car.
Get rid of this mattress.
Let's spread the map on the table and talk it over.
Rima and Skura called Mina again.
I had a baby girl the year after I got married.
We're letting you go. "Fuck you and your company."
Santiago tried to hide the camera from Rima.
He doesn't have much money.
Did you find any common ground?
Tom has warned me about that.
You aren't supposed to smoke in here.
I just ordered a beer.
Yesterday I watched this film for the ninth time already.
You're gonna be in serious trouble.

We go to church every Sunday.
I don't have my purse.
Sami's school is very different.
I'm not finding a formula.
This excitement may not last.
Bruno was puzzled by Rima’s behavior.
I wonder whether Tom really forgot to tell Mary what to do.
Have you any references from your other employers?
Can you give me a kilo of steak?
Tom wouldn't have been able to get his homework done if Mary hadn't helped him.
Tom said he was too shy to do that.
They looked like they were sleeping.
Everybody in this family goes to church every Sunday.
I think that you're rushing this a little.
I bet you're wondering why I did that.

Tom may be scared.
Tom doesn't want to let Mary down.
You look like you're committed.
Good show!
Maybe they are happy.
We always go home together.
Tom isn't polite.
Tom should've done much better on the test.

Can you reach it?
I do not work on Sunday.
We enjoy a jaunt to the wonderful, waterfront city of Portsmouth.
They have sugar.
Tom thought I was the only one who wanted to do that.
All the visitors went back home one after another.
I knew that Tom wouldn't likely have to do that.
Skura died immediately.
Sami needs those sixty dollars.
When lo! – the tale I shudder to pursue – / from Tenedos in silence, side by side, / two monstrous serpents, horrible to view, / with coils enormous leaning on the tide, / shoreward, with even stretch, the tranquil sea divide.
He built himself a house.
Listen to your heart.
Tom doesn't appreciate your courage.
This means that others can only come to know you and like you by listening to what you say.
