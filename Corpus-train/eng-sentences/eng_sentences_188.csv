My Syncretism deals with Animisms as Daoism, Shintō, Native-world Animism, and so forth, as well as Buddhism and Hinduism, but I do not discount Xtian-type ideas from Jehovah's Witnesses, Gnosticism, and my birth religion, Roman Catholicism. My Lojbanism entails the study of Lojban and the practice in expressing spirituality in it, either by writing or making soliloquies.
