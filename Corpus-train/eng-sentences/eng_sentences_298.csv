Even Tom doesn't hug Mary anymore.
They said that they had contracts.
Are there any issues we need to discuss?
Tom, you do know this is a public forum, don't you? Throwing a hissy fit because people happened to misinterpret your Facebook post makes you seem controlling and humourless, and more or less guarantees still more mocking responses.

I was impressionable to these images and ideas at a young age. By my thirties, I became interested in other Eastern philosophies like Daoism and Hinduism.
