Tom and Mary were both pretty busy yesterday.
I fell on the floor.
Algeria boasts enormous oil and gas riches.
Tom is at home, sleeping.
She smiled at me and then I smiled at her.
Could you wait a moment for me?

Yanni didn't have a fridge in his hut in the forest.
It's not too much to ask you to come to class on time.
I would have thee to understand this, and would tell thee before all that sit here, and before the ancients of my people. If thou wilt take possession of it by the right of kindred: buy it, and possess it: but if it please thee not, tell me so, that I may know what I have to do. For there is no near kinsman besides thee, who art first, and me, who am second. But he answered: I will buy the field.
My dad doesn't want me driving there everyday, so he's paying my rent.

I'm pretty sure Tom isn't going to win.
Why don't we go someplace else?
It's the best house in town.
The house is very old. It needs to be repaired before you sell it.
Tom says he should do that.
He has a scratch on his forehead.
He'll drive.
Someone will be meeting you.
They can think and speak.

Dmitri attacked Rima.
Ziri became a mathematician.
Yanni removed the stems of the figs.

I can't get enough of you touching me.
In half a year she'll be going abroad.

She has been sick in bed since last Monday.
I need more speaking practice.
Tom isn't really my type.
That armored truck is carrying gold.
Do you think Tom is sympathetic?
Will you give me some?
At this remarkable moment in history, more people live in freedom than ever before. Our alliances are stronger than ever. People all around the world look to America to be a force for peace and prosperity, freedom and security.

Aren't you going to do anything?
Tell me, where were you born?

I've just received some delightful news.
You don't think I need to do that, do you?
God is the all-wise.
The quality is really bad.
I still think about him.
Why don't we order a pizza, so you don't have to cook?
I doubt that Tom really has time to do that today.
A self-fulfilling prophecy is a prophecy that causes itself to be true, directly or indirectly.

Have you already read the newspaper?
Suddenly, Mary found herself in the middle of a controversy.
Layla looks so gorgeous.
I think we found it.
It isn't possible to get there by car.
And so I said T.M.I., Tom. Too much information. I don't want to hear about your gross surgery, said Mary. "I know he is disgusting," said Mary's sister.
