I'm glad that I was able to meet you yesterday.
My blood type is A positive.
Sami is going to think that Layla is insane.
Sami saw Layla's little brother.
I don't understand your words.
Tom has some matters to take care of.
Where are my red stockings?
Tom and Mary didn't tell John they were unhappy.
I was surprised Tom didn't win.
William wanted to find information about Sandra.
I brought one.
Try to put yourself in Tom's shoes.
Tom took his sneakers off.
Don't do that! That's gross.
I need a blanket.
I know you've always cared about Tom.
I have seen wolves in the Appennines.
Ziri has to live by the rules.
Let's postpone our decision until next week.
We still have a month left.
Were you able to go to the hospital?
My income has decreased ten percent.
In ancient times people believed that the earth was flat.
I'm sure Tom will be absent.
Yanni is overly self-critical.
Ziri's body was found in the garage.
What do you do in Kabylie? "I'm a Berber teacher."
She's madly in love with her.
Look! There's a plane taking off.
It isn't going to be easy for Tom.
Unfortunately Tom isn't healthy.
Tom was low on health, but he found a health pack just in time.
It’s such an honor for me to be here with you all.
You are tired, aren't you?
I want to know whether what I'm doing is right.
Raise up your left hand.
What are you playing?
Do you want to consider another possibility?
Christ, we adore you.
That's my favorite bar.

What's your favorite sports team?
I'll bring this.

Is she happy?
Tom went out the front door.
He may come and see us tonight.
Tom took a big gulp of water.
Tom wouldn't let anyone in his room.
A man came up and spoke to me.
Tom wanted help.
I think you're doing a fine job.

You should talk to me, too.
The promenade runs parallel to the shore.
Do you shave your armpits?
Tom is not overly friendly.
She repainted her house.
The Internet is a fad.

If I leave my suitcase here, will you watch it for me?
Dan died of his gunshot wound.
She really wants to go.
Please don't waste my time.
He is dishonored.
His brother wants to become a Muslim.
I'm counting on you guys.
Keep your hands off me.
I just want to ask Tom a few questions.
He put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a sweet.
He claims his wife doesn't understand him.
Give me his picture.
Tom is agnostic.
You'd better write Tom a letter, I think.
Tom and Mary left their car unlocked.
Mary is a very attractive woman in her early thirties.
I'm not working for free.
The ship heeled over on her side, and the water rushed into the hold.
She stuck a poster on the wall.
Ok, let's give it a try.
Tom had no income then.
I did that once with my friends.
They told me that they thought they could win.
Writing in a diary is a good habit.
William and Sandra coincidentally ordered the same thing.
Tom will take the bus.
I've helped a lot, I think.
Fix my toy.
It's easy to catch a cold.
I caught up with the others.
When they had read what was written on the stone, the younger brother said:
Tom fell into the ice-cold water of the river.
I think what you're doing is stupid.
What'll you give me for this?
This is a demonstrative pronoun.
I have given it back.
Tom later confirmed this.
How do you tell the time in Berber?
I'm sitting here with Tom.
We're Kabyle!
They told me that they have decided not to do that.

They'll do that if they have to.
They said that they were ready to help.
Tom has been living in Boston for a long time.
Do people eat well in this restaurant?
Yanni's house is full of trash and smells of mold.
She has already published two books.
I wouldn't rule out the possibility of moving to another country if I get a good job offer.
I have a great support system.
She's paid to do that, isn't she?
Tom said that isn't the only reason we should do that.
Tom reached for the bottle.
Tom said that he thought that Mary was doing that today.
I held my breath in excitement.
He is respected by everybody.
Tom needs to remember that.
Mennad never wears beanies.
This letter is too long to have it translated at a reasonable price.
I don't think that Tom knows how to do the breast stroke.
I bought myself a kite.
There is no one standard for beauty.
I think we are much better off than we used to be.
Tom looked at Mary without saying anything.

Ziri decided to quit his job.
The hair on the back of his neck rose.
It's a very good sign.
I gave Tom everything he wanted.

Quit being so politically correct.
She's too young for that, isn't she?
I don't think that you'll have the same problems I had.
Gabriel was only a few years older than Melissa.

I know that most people here can't speak French.
Do you have this in a bigger size?
We were attacked in the forest.
Do you know what I think? "No, what?"
I was awfully confused by his question.
I was almost always at the top of the class.
Sami didn't talk throughout the entire day.
Do you recognize that woman?
Tom could've prevented it.
A deep and powerful male voice began chanting.
I'm having problems with them.
Have you explained what the risks are?
Do you spend a lot of money on clothes?
Will we have a hot summer?
Tom walked around campus carrying his laptop.
Kisses!
He can hardly speak Berber properly.
Tom doesn't think Mary really meant to do that.
The scarred man presented a warm smile.
His salary increased by ten percent.
Stop being such a snob.
It ended badly for Tom.

He's a beginner, but he learns fast.
The animal made a squeaking sound.
Dance with me, please.
I made my way through the crowd.
Karl went to look for Rima’s.
Can I just have a sip of your wine?
Algeria has many opportunities to develop.
I told her exactly what I saw.
I think that Colorado has a lot of dispensaries.
Her morals are flexible.
I hope that this doesn't happen again.
Don't make him angry.
Do we have to get rid of that?
Is your father a priest?
Tom is working in Boston.
Tom and Mary weren't expecting you to do that for them.
Are you going to be getting on my nerves for a long time?

I'll meet you at the hospital.
Tom realized Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary spent the money John gave them on something to eat.
Tom couldn't eat.
You need to take a shower before you go to the party.
Tom says he was sick that day, which is—pardon my French—bullshit.
He was ill last week.
Are you planning to help him?
Is her head red?
I'm afraid the number is engaged.
I can't take any calls right now.
Do you want to try this new recipe I found?
I wonder if you have something to write with.
There's a paper towel holder next to the sink.
It seems stupid to me to do that.
Do you like your mother language?
I object to you going to Europe alone.
You have two options: São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
I'm starting to get cold.
The ability to quote is a serviceable substitute for wit.
The impossible was achieved.
They knocked on the door and said they had come to arrest him.
Dan has been troubled by recurring nightmares.
I have no time for trifles, he answered, brusquely.
