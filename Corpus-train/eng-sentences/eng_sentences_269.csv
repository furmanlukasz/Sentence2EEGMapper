It is the 6th of September of 2013. I have reached the point of being an Esperantist to have confidence in speaking despite my scarce exposure to those others who speak Esperanto. I have more confidence in speaking Esperanto than I do with Japanese or Spanish or French. I can make poetic phrases in Lojban and Interlingua, but that way is as far as they go, which is not really conversation. I can converse well enough in Esperanto. But reading is pleasure enough. Not many people that I have met feel satisfied in just being able to read in an extra language, but I do feel satisfied hearing the words in my inner mind. With varying fluency, I can read over ten languages. (I do not really count them because some are like knowledge shades.) There are five skills in language: the listening, the speaking, the reading, the writing, and the making of music. Some polyglots are not good in all five for each language that they know. They treasure those skills of which they are capable.
