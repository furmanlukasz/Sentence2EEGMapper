Marriage is not a simple act in which two individuals sign a paper. Marriage is an act in which two people declare before the law, before God, and before themselves that they will commit themselves to being friends, partners, everything necessary for the other's life to be happy. That he or she will feel happy to see his or her loved one happy. That you are committed to the life of the person you are marrying. Marriage is not a military or electoral obligation: it is the declaration that two people love each other and want to share a life together.
