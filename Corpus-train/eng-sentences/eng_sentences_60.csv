We, Joki and I, talked for a long time that evening, the 10th of March of 2020, as if she were downloading everything important into my brain. She was an avid fan of spirituality. An interesting thing that she said that struck me as wild was that if some people wanted to end the world, then the world would end for them, whilst people who did not want the end would not see it. Different people would see a different "show." Thoughts affected one's reality. She talked about "spirits" and "ghosts." She talked of "dimensions" and "frequencies" concerning spiritual "ascension." She was curious of the word "divine." She believed in sentients on other "planets" in other "solar systems" in other "galaxies." She liked astronomy and cosmology.

I went hiking with the group.
Tom and Mary are no longer together.
Tom has been on a power trip since he was promoted to manager.
They say they hope you do that.

He sat at the bar drinking by himself.
There wasn't a single free seat in the hall.
I knew Tom wouldn't be able to swim all the way to the island.
Sami is a real nightmare.
I looked to see if he was teasing me.
Tom used to enjoy teaching French.

I would like to clarify a few things.
We all decided to meet up on Thursday.
She is his complete opposite.

Let me see your face, sweetie. I miss you.

Have you attained your goal?
We'll try to be there early.

Please tell me all the things you don't like about me.
A sinkhole has appeared in the middle of the highway.
As long as you don't tell Tom where it is, I'm sure he won't find it.
Come back to the party.

Can you help me Monday afternoon?
He and I'll go with her.
I'll do that tomorrow. "That's what you said yesterday."

That'll be thirteen dollars. The cashier had rounded up to the nearest dollar. Odd, but who cared? It was all Tom could do to keep his arm from shaking as he slammed a crumpled $20 bill on the countertop and grabbed his stuff, not even bothering to pick up the change. "Come again," the cashier recited. "The hell I will," Tom grumbled under his breath as he speed-walked to his car, relieved that was over, still trying to figure out how to free himself from John’s grasp.
I think I know what Tom and Mary are doing here.
He said he would be back before midnight.
You should turn yourselves in.
We need to renew our passports.
Tom told me that he didn't want me to do that again.
