I need your professional advice.

How can you accuse me of such a thing? I would never lay a hand on my child.

Filipino culture is highly aural-oral when it comes to the indigenous language. Older generations, with greater Americanization, tend to write in English, when they have to write. However, texting on cellphones is often done in clipped Tagalog. Tagalog needs more literature. The translation to Tagalog of Kirsten Nimwey's fantasy book The Explorers impresses me. But the vastness and sophistication of the literature of Tagalog's southern brother, Indonesian, really outdo Tagalog's. Being aural-oral, Tagalog-users emphasize television, film, and videos.

You can clean a paintbrush with turpentine.
Tom handed Mary the keys.
A serious linguistic institution won't ever censure a translation, it does not matter how dirty or rude it feels when reading it.
I think Tom and Mary are conceited.
The US and its mercenaries in the Middle East know very well that Iran is militarily capable of killing tens of thousands of their troops with its missiles, well-trained troops and well-armed Shiite militia across the region and I don't think that Washington and its allies want the world to witness the shattering of the myth of the "invincibility" of their armies. There is no doubt that Iran could be obliterated by dozens of nuclear bombs launched by US submarines and a nearby rogue state, but Tehran wouldn't go down without a fight of apocalyptic proportions. Fighting Iran militarily would show the world that the world's 1st and 4th militaries could lose tens of thousands of troops at a level never seen since World War II.
Yanni has finally arrived.
I told her to come.
Where can I pick up my airplane ticket?

Thank you for coming!
